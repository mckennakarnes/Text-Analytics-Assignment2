0,"March 23, 2002  7:04PM",cybersol,"Entry level performance luxury sedans are a hot area for car manufacturers and enthusiasts alike.  These sedans show their performance by being fun to drive and handling well.  They show luxury by offering leather and some of the important creatures comforts found in the most luxurious upscale sedans. The selection of vehicles that compete in the space is vast and varied.The benchmarks which define this are the BMW 330 and the Audi A4 3.0.  But there are many contenders, such as Acura TL-S, Chrysler 300M, Jaguar X-type, Infiniti I35, Mercedes C-Class, Volvo S60 T5.  Some companies have contenders that emphasize performance Lexus IS300 or luxury Lexus ES300.  And the field is continously growing, with the recent additions being the Cadillac CTS and Infiniti G35.The common charateristics of this entry level perfomance luxury group seem to a price around 30 to 40k (US dollars) and 0-60 times between six and eight seconds.With this wide variety of cars targeted at a similar market segment, the choices for our own personal car are great.  But with all these choices, it is hard to understand and personally evaluate all these options.  So this topic has been created to start a discussion on the relative merits and personalities of the cars available in this entry level performance luxury field."
1,"March 25, 2002  5:54AM",merc1,"I personally think that with a few tweaks the C320 could also sit at the top of this group.  It's still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than Mercedes would lead you to believe.   The C320 ""Sport"" needs to have it's suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride.  MB also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package.  The C240's 6-speed wouldn't hurt either if offered on the C320, though it needs to be ""fixed"" first. That said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new A4 3.0.   The A4 easily has the best interior of any sub-40K car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite.   The single thing I don't like about the A4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car.  This trim doesn't match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway.   This is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40K.  The upcoming A4 Convertible, Coupe and S4 WILL all be winners. The BMW 330i is now an old favorite, but I'm (of all people) starting to tire of the 3-Series just a bit, save the M3 variants.   I was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling.  I hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models. The Acura TL-S is easily my favorite fwd car in this class.  Wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver.  Nice price, seats and what not, not hard to see why the TL is so popular.  This car's main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc.  Otherwise a standout. Lexus ES300.  Nice, but not my type of car at all.  This is one for the Buick set.  The IS300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis.  Styling is also in question here, it simply doesn't look like a 35K car (grown).  The interior is gawd-awful.  Bet on the next IS300 being done right from the start.  In their defense Toyota didn't initially intend for this car to be sold in the U.S. so it was a rush job. The CTS holds the greatest unrealized potential here.  I've seen several now, and each time I see one they look better and better.  Again like the C320, IS300 the car has interior issues.  The dash feels like it was made by Rubbermaid.  If you're going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother?  Half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car???  The seats are very good though, as is the handling.  A work in progress. The G35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces.  Another great engine, waiting to drive this one.Don't really care much for the X-Type.  If I were a Jaguar man I'd be truly pissed at Ford and Jaguar for this one.  They are actually selling a fwd X-Type in England and I've read where they're thinking about selling it here!  Hell no.  The car should have been rwd not awd.  Some will tell you that this was done to compete with Audi.  Thats BS, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, WITHOUT spending the money to convert the car to rwd.  It is a good looking car though and that Jaguar ""leaper"" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me. The Chrysler 300M is about as close to an Audi that American cars come.  This new 300M ""Special"" is truly a good looking car inside and out.  One problem: Where is the performance????  A 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable.  Something is not right here.  Some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, Chrysler needs to let some MB engineers have a look at this car.  The heavier E320 with less power is faster.   I still like this car, but it's no lust object once you get past the great styling.  M"
2,"March 25, 2002  7:06AM",fredvh,I am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. The price difference between these two is approx. 6K (non-Type S Acura). Is the ES300 worth 6K over the TL? I don't know because I have never owned a TL but I am familiar with the ES300(previous generation). Supposedly the 2002 ES300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the TL? Of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. Does the TL compare with the ES300 in both of these categorys? I am not familiar with the Honda Co. Are prices lower than Lexus for service work? I would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some TL owners.
3,"March 25, 2002  5:02PM",blueguydotcom,"Great handling, RWD, excellent engine and the best warranty around.  Easy winner."
4,"March 25, 2002 11:04PM",hungrywhale,"And no manual tranny.  That may not matter to you, but it most certainly does matter to me and many other enthusiast drivers.So IMO, it's not even on the board, let alone the 'easy winner'."
5,"March 26, 2002 12:44AM",riez,"One beauty of BMW 3 Series is that there are so many models to choose from.  Almost half of all buyers in America don't get the basic RWD 4 door sedan.  Besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices, you can get coupe, convertible, AWD, station wagon, and super-high performance M-Series!!!hungrywhale...  I concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical!!!"
6,"March 26, 2002  8:20PM",blueguydotcom,"good grief, so you wait 9 months for the manual.  Even with an auto, I prefer to every car listed and I NEVER have owned an auto and never thought I'd enjoy driving a car with an auto.  That's what value, performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car.  Once the G has a stick there is not another sedan under the M3 that I'd consider."
7,"March 26, 2002  9:02PM",hungrywhale,"I'll give it a fair shot when the manual comes out, but I'm just flat-out not interested in an auto.  I don't care how fast it is.  It's not about the speed, it's about the driving experience and having more control over the car."
8,"March 26, 2002  9:45PM",blueguydotcom,"I understand it's not about the speed.  I really don't care if the car won't do over 100 as I rarely break the century mark.  What I do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto, I can get it when I want it.  Will I buy an auto-equipped G?  In all likelihood, no.  I desperately want to drive the 6 speed."
9,"March 27, 2002 12:00AM",hungrywhale,It sounds like you know why I won't even put it on my list (let alone at the top) until the manual comes out.
10,"March 27, 2002  2:00AM",riez,"Is there such a thing as an automatic-only true performance sedan?  Not in my book.  Certainly not in Europe or Asia.  Only in America is such an oxymoron possible.  Sad.If or when the manual G35 comes out and the coupe version, then the G35 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment."
11,"March 27, 2002  2:55AM",wishnhigh1,"If I had to rank the entry lux performance sedans, here is what I would choose:Audi A4 3.0(lots of bang for the buck, loads of style and loads of luxury)Cadillac CTS( Decent BTFB, good handling, non-lemming style)Infinity G35(Tons of BFTB, good luxury, but completely boring exterior and even more boring of an interior)BMW 325(very little BFTB, excellent handling/build quality/resale, classy looking but too conservative for me)SAAB Viggen(almost zero BFTB, spotty build quality, but the damn coolest style in the world).

But I think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a Infiniti G35 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan.  From your logic, then the BMW 3-series (your wife's) or the 5-series with the Steptronic should not be contenders either. That's belittling the Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, Acuras, BMW's etc. with automatics. When I return in December from Qatar, I plan on purchasing a sports sedan. I'm leaning on the G35, but the BMW 330i along with the Audi S4 are also contenders. IMO, if the handling of the Infiniti is as good as the BMW as some that drove it has stated, then it will hard to pass up especially for the price. Also my first choice will be a manual, and Infiniti should have the manual out by December. I will test drive all three, manual and automatics, and make my choice from there. I do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive, and that will be my first choice. But, automatics in this category, especially those made by BMW, Infiniti and others, should not be eliminated as performance sedans. Different flavors for different people.I have been following discussions on many boards and what I have been noticing is that there is so many ""experts"" on what is the best sports sedan. And most haven't even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion. This is not aimed at you Riez or Shipko, because your profiles states that you own a BMW already. But from what I noticed is that some BMW ""supportors"" don't even own a BMW, (at least not from their profile) or they state that they never drove an Infiniti G35, but they still make ""unsupported"" facts, assumptions or opinions on such. (See the Edmund's BMW 3-series discussion).  I hope in your defense, Reiz, that you drove the automatic Infiniti G35, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn't classify as a performance sedan. I value your opinion and others as well.Again, I'm not flaming you, but I try to be an informed consumer before I buy anything. That is the reason that I will drive every car that I'm interested in and make my choice from there. I'm also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car I'm shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.Cheers!"
14,"March 27, 2002  5:00PM",hungrywhale,"I think what riez and I are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them But any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan NEEDS at least the option of a manual tranny.  Manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.There's nothing at all wrong with automatics, but I sure don't want one."

16,"March 27, 2002  6:23PM",dave330i,"In this class, the best bang for the buck has to be IS300, assuming one can live with the styling. I guess I'm one of the few that likes the old A4 styling to the new. Isn't the new A4 pushing 3600 lbs. now? That's pretty heavy for this class."
17,"March 27, 2002  7:06PM",blueguydotcom,"Even at 29k for a 35k msrp IS300, I passed on it.  Now I never drove a manual one (they weren't out yet) but even with a manual, given the car's horrible drive-feel, poor interior and lethargic steering, I don't think I'd go near one.  They're not up to Audi/BMW/MB/Infiniti."
18,"March 27, 2002  8:42PM",wishnhigh1,"Never liked a lexus, and probably never will. I would rather drive the CTS. There is always something that irritates me about them. I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus...I personally think Lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character. Toyota deserves something like it though. Also, I don't think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck, considering the G35 is the same price with 260 horsies."
19,"March 27, 2002  8:46PM",dave330i,"""I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus""How else are they going to get that extra $5k from you then? Reasonably equipped G35 goes for $33k or so."
20,"March 27, 2002  9:10PM",riez,"I couldn't have said it better myself.  I'll let you lead services!  mbarto...  I most certainly will test a G35 manual if and when it finally comes out.  I promise!!!  Automatics make nice luxury sedans and maybe even sporty luxury sedans.  But NOT performance sedans or luxury performance sedans.  (I don't even consider the 540iA Sport truly worthy, though it is as close as one can get in an automatic.  If I could just get my wife to drive a manual....)"
21,"March 28, 2002  7:43AM",mbarto,"Thanks Riez! Let me know when you do.  I'm sure you'll get a chance before I will since I won't return until December. I am curious of how it compares to the BMW's. YOU can speak from experience, so I'll value your opinion.It does make a difference being married. (LOL!  see the latest discussions on the Infiniti G35 vs BMW 330i board).  First, I'm fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual. Not that she prefers that, her first choice is an automatic.  But she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice I'm doing out here, and knows that this car is for me first, family second. Of course, it helps my cause when I let her buy a new dining room set last month, and new living room drapes this month. Bribes do help! Whatever I finally decide, I'm sure she'll be happy."
22,"March 29, 2002 12:07AM",riez,"mbarto... As regards the ""bribes"" issue, you've figured out one of life's great truism:  You get what you want so I can get what I want."""
23,"April  5, 2002 10:34PM",cybersol,"So if someone were looking to purchase a new performance luxury sedan today, what cars would they HAVE to take a look at and test drive?  Lets say they only had time to look at five?What five would they have to look into?"
24,"April  6, 2002 12:16AM",riez,"Since it has to have a manual transmission and should be RWD (AWD/4WD adds too much weight and complexity) and has to be fun to drive hard...1.  BMW 3 Series manual2.  Lexus IS300 manual3.  Cadillac CTS manual4.  Lincoln LS6 manualIf you want affordable and can go FWD, then add Nissan Maxima 6-speed with LSD and maybe Altima 3.5SE 5-speed.Try to get car with LSD.  Inline 6s are magnificently smooth engines.Possible future car:  Infiniti G35 sedan when it finally gets the 6-speed manual."
25,"April  7, 2002  3:22PM",coolguyky7,"The TL should be up for redesign in a few years so a TL would be outdated in the not so far future.  And besides, it seems like everyone who drives an Acura drives the TL.  I LOVE the ES300.  Some say it looks bloated; I don't think it does.  At the 3/4 angle, it looks impressive.  The interior is as nice as a car can get.  If I had the money, I would buy an ES300 in a heartbeat.  I never did like the past ones' boring styling...especially since the last two generations were nearly twins.  Go with the ES.  Besides, Lexus' quality is ahead of Acura's."
26,"April  7, 2002 10:59PM",kdshapiro,"The new ES is a very smart looking car. Notwithstanding any engine issues though, I think there are direct price competitors like the I35 that offer better overall value on paper. Now I haven't driven either new model, I did drive the older ES300 and it did it's job very well. They are both great cars. Lexus for legendary reliability and resale value, Infiniti for up-to-date features."
27,"April  8, 2002 10:32PM",blueguydotcom,"Um...you left off the Infiniti G35 and it's bland, boring brother the I35 (the ES300's competition).29k gets someone a 4 door 260 HP performance entry level luxury sedan with all sorts of goodies."
28,"April  9, 2002  9:12PM",jagboyxkr,"Sorry, I thought that I had already taken up too much space, and I also was getting tired of typing.  When I check out an Infiniti G35, maybe I'll post something on it.I always thought the I35's looked all right, even if they aren't the most exciting cars ever built."
29,"April  9, 2002  9:43PM",blueguydotcom,"Go drive one.  They're a blast and for the money they're a steal.  If someone wants entry level performance luxury at a great price, the G's really tough to beat.  Save for BMW, it sort of stands head and shoulders over most of its competition."
30,"April 12, 2002  2:53PM",merc1,"Well I'm a Benz fan first and foremost, but the A4 3.0 CVT just offers more for the money.  The A4 has a better interior, the top A4 engine (compared to the C240, which is the base C) and it's styling is at least as good as the Benz if not better.   Both makes pay for scheduled maint during the warranty period.    Neither car will be ""low maintanence"" after the warranty runs out, especially the Audi with it's fairly different transmission.   If you're priced these cars and they've come out equal go for the Audi it's the better value here. M"
31,"April 14, 2002  8:09AM",popovs,"I think both are excellent(sp?) cars, however neither one is a low maintenance automobile. That is to say neither brand is known for low maintenance.  What they do offer is luxury and performance in an aesthetically pleasing package and, some would argue, a superior ownership experience.As someone has said before, every manifacturer makes lemons - some more than others - but the internet is not the best place to find information about that.  Most people are just venting and are not representative of the owner community.  Although I can not speak as to the driving merits of the cars, I suspect that they are similar since I've heard (read) good things about both the A4 CVT and the C240.  Something to keep in mind is that anytime a new product is offered by the industry, it usually takes a couple of years for the company to work out all the bugs in the technology.  Both cars are relative newcommers to the market.  The facts that they are made by distinguished companies and use proven powerplants does not speak conclusively as to how reliable the cars will be as a whole.Since you are already looking for alternatives to the MB because of reliability concerns, it may be worth your time to look at other alternatives than the Audi.  As someone has suggested in the Help me Choose! forum, try looking to Lexus for the answer.  They seem to make reliable cars that are also cheap to keep running.  Of course now we get into the issue of European vs Asian luxury ..."
32,"April 17, 2002  9:23AM",popovs,"It has come to my attention that as of late MB has taken a hit in its reputation.  People have been quick to point at the recent survey results - both European and Domestic - that say Mercedes is no longer reliable.  These surveys show that statistically speaking MB has as much as doubled the amount of repairs that they do under warranty.  I won't deny these findings, but I will try and justify them.  1st and foremost, MB has and is comming out with newer designs every year, updating the cars both inside and out.  Anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out.  Secondly, according to mbspy.com, Mercedes accounted for ~half of the profits by DCX last year.  I think MB is being used as a cash cow to keep Jeep and Co affloat, thereby driving Mercedes to cost-cutting through corparate pressure.  Lower quality parts equal lower overall car quality.These two should get things going ... Feel free to agree or disagree."
33,"April 17, 2002  7:37PM",mvargo1,"There is not much to debate on this subject.  If you want a reliable car you buy Japanese.  If you want a drivers car you used to have to buy european.  The Japanese just do quality better and more consistantly than anyone else.  You also get a lot more car for your money with a Japanese vehicle.  There was a time when the europeans built the best driving cars in the world.  Sadly for them those days are passing.  The Japanese keep building cars that are closer and closer to european driving dynamics (IS and GS series Lexus(Lexi?), and Q45 and G35 Infiniti's)  While the europeans quality especially Daimler/Chrysler just is not keeping up."

35,"April 18, 2002 11:12PM",cybersol,"I'm interested more towards performance than luxury.  Also value is an important component for me.  Although I have the money to buy these cars, I also have other fun things and places to spend it.  I'm looking to buy the car and keep it for around 7-10 years.  Its very sunny with no snow here as well.  I also want an automatic or CVT(gasp).So right now, the five I am going to look at more closely are as follows:1) BMW 330i2) Audi A4 3.0 CVT3) Infiniti G354) Acura TL-S5) Nissan Altima 3.5 SEThe BMW represents the top of the class, but it also has the highest price.  The Altima represents the most performance oriented family car, which is a cheaper class of cars.  The BMW and Altima will bracket the value equation.  The other three all have the potential to compete for my dollars.Cars that are missing, IS300 too small, while the styling of the CTS, S60 T5, and 9-5 Aero are not for me.  The ES300 and I35 don't have enough performance for me.  Everything more expensive than a comparibly equipped 330i was also excluded.What do you guys think? Anything missing?Thanks,cybersol"
36,"April 18, 2002 11:50PM",riez,"cybersol...  I can't fathom why you would want to go with slushbox, but that is your loss.Comparing FWD to RWD is like apples to oranges.Not sure what sort of real price range you are looking at.  The 330i with options might push $40,000.  You might really consider the much less expensive 325i.  An Altima 3.5SE with few options might have a $25,000 MSRP.Read Motor Trend's review of I35.  Their's had more than enough performance.  0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds, fastest in their comparison test.  And it can be had with a Sport Package.  But you might be better off with a loaded Maxima SE or GLE, saving thousands off the I35.You might also consider Volkwagen Passat.  That can also be had with AWD.  If you like AWD, the Jag X-type should be on your list.From the domestic corner, you might also consider a Lincoln LS 6 or 8.  Or Chrysler 300M.Surprised your list excludes the Mercedes-Benz C-class. And if you can live with a FWD automatic, a loaded Camry or Accord V-6 or Avalon might be acceptable near the Altima's price range."
37,"April 19, 2002  1:07AM",cybersol,"Sorry to disappoint with the slushbox, but if we were all the same life would be boring (and there would only be 1 car type). I would prefer RWD, but the best FWD's (torque sensitive steering) are getting close enough to bring the acceptable price premium for RWD down. Price range is 25-40K as you mention.Passat, 300M, 325i, are too slow for me.  The C Classes are either too slow or more expensive than the BMW.  I would choose the BMW over the X-type, as they are similarly priced and I live in sun country.The maxima (better value than the I35) is a good suggestion, and I am considering that equally with the Altima at the lower end.My wife loves Camry's, but I'm looking for excitement.  slushbox or not.Thanks,cybersol"
38,"April 19, 2002  2:14AM",kdshapiro,"The new Altima is great as my friends just bought one. However, dollar for dollar I think the Maxima is the over-all winner for a FWD car. If you can live without the amenities of the I35 the GLE with leather, sunroof, BOSE can't be beat. I've owned two Maximas. Me! I recently made the jump to the 330i, and it's been worth every penny. However the G35 owners are very passionate about their choices. For a couple of dollars more than the Maxima, hovering around the I35 I guess, the TL-S can't be beat either.I understand when it comes down to it, you pick what you think has the right combination of value, performance, luxury and the right type of car for you. For every person it is different. When I got the BMW I was cross-shopping SUVs, mini-vans, and FWD passenger cars to see what struck my fancy, and I was ready to get an Explorer."
39,"April 19, 2002  2:18AM",riez,"cybersol... Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible.  I can't get too excited about FWDers.  Certainly not a slushbox FWDer.Not sure what you mean about ""the best FWDers (torque sensitive steering)"".Very powerful FWDers tend to suffer from severe torque steering.  Use of equal length half-shafts and limited slip differential can help, but not completely eliminate.  The laws of physics remain.  When the drive wheels and steering wheels are one and the same, and you have a powerful motor, you'll get some torque steering.Do you have kids?  Plan to in near future?  If not, have you considered any coupes or convertibles?  They can be a bit more exciting."
40,"April 19, 2002  3:28PM",dave330i,"""Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible.""Agreed. Unfortunately, most American drivers don't seem to get it. They care about silly stuff like 0-60, 1/4 mile, hp & torque numbers, but choose to miss out on the fun part of driving."
41,"April 20, 2002  8:18AM",cybersol,"Riez, you have heard of speed sensitive steering?  This varies the power steering boost as with the speed.  Acura claims to have torque sensitive power steering on the TL-S (not the TL though).  This would supposedly vary the power steering boost with the torque being applied.  And that in theory could eliminate a large amount of torque steer found in powerful FWD cars.  It still doesn't eliminate the FWD tendency to under steer due the the drive wheels being the same as the turning wheels."
42,"April 20, 2002  4:49PM",riez,"cybersol...  There are two types.  Those tied to engine output and those tied to road speed.  I have heard that the latter are superior, since you can vary engine speeds (RPMs) a lot, depending upon gear being used and speed, even while driving relative steady speeds.  Better systems vary boost on road speed, since you normally need more assist at low speeds, regardless of engine RPMs.Here is all that the lengthy full-color TL brochure says:  ""Steering: Variable Power-Assist Rack-and-Pinion"".  This is off the tech specs on page 30.  I cannot find a single mention of the steering system anywhere else in the brochure.  So if Acura thinks its variable assist power steering system is special, they are keeping it a secret.  This large brochure covers both the TL and TL Type S."
43,"April 21, 2002  7:36AM",cybersol,"Yeah, I have that brouchure and they don't mention the difference between the TL and TL-S, though they say both have variable power assist.  They do not say how it varies.
But on the Acura website.  TL -> Specifications -> Body/Suspension/Chassis it says:Steering Type TL Type S - Torque-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering 3.2TL - Speed-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steeringHere's the link if you want to check it out:http://www.acura.com/model_TL/tl_spec_results.aspHard to find, but not a secret."
44,"April 21, 2002  1:50PM",riez,"cybersol...  From what I've read, the better variable power assist system is tied to road speed, not engine RPMs.  Once you get a car up to 25 mph or more, there isn't much need for assist, even if your RPMs decline due to turning or downshifting.  And certainly once you hit 45 mph or more there isn't much need for assist no matter what happens to your RPMs.But keep in mind that torque steering isn't due to the steering system.  It is due to other factors.  Can be very pronounced in powerful FWDers.  Corrective actions include limited slip differentials and equal half-shafts.  Need to provide equal power simultaneously to drive wheels.From standing start, floor your car.  See if the wheel pulls in one direction.  You'll have to correct with the steering wheel (to keep the car straight) but by then you'll have already encountered the torque steering.  You can also notice it if you are aggressively accelerating in a curve.  Wheels pull you out of your intended direction and you have to correct."
45,"April 24, 2002  2:51PM",beartrax79,"So, if you read through most of this group, alot of references went out to Audi... give a guy a hand here and compare an Audi A4 3.0 to an Audi S4... I see a difference of about $5K, 30hp, and a sporty suspension.  Why shouldn't I load up a 3.0, rather than going after the S4?Oh, and does anyone know on possible improvements for one or the other for 2003?"
46,"April 25, 2002 12:15AM",cybersol,"Have you driven them both?  The S4 really moves.  Even by Audi's own 0-60 times the S4 manual is 1 second faster and the S4 tiptronic is 1.2 seconds faster.  Yet, the S4 is currently based on the 2001 A4 platform, and it is scheduled to be upgraded to the new platform in the 2003 model year.  Expect the performance difference to increase as the indications are that the new S4 will pack 300 or more hp.Hope this helps."

48,"April 26, 2002  4:50PM",cybersol,"Yeah, the current S4 has 250 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque.  The torque is fully online by 1850 rpm.  So this is why it scoots.  The new S4 should be really nice.  If you have the time to wait, it might be worth seeing.  It might move up in price a little if the performance gets closer to the BMW M3, but then the old S4's should be easier to pick up at a good price right as the new ones are coming out.

49,"April 27, 2002  9:37PM",1pierce,"Not so fast.  There is merit to the ""nationality based"" debate.  Let me explain to you why Japanese cars have higher quality (in terms of reliability) than American or European cars.  The reason is cultural.Americans have always had an adventurous, entrepreneurial spirit.  We take chances.  Its not in our nature to ""accept"" things as they are.  I think this is somewhat genetic, since the vast number of us are descended from immigrants - aren't we all, really - people who took tremendous risk, and had great courage to brave the unknown for the promise of a new and better life.  As such, in areas of design, we bore very easily.  Americans are always looking for the next great thing, the next new design, the next technology breakthrough.  Europeans, especially Germans, are like this about cars, if not about everything else.  The US auto industry is always ready to chuck the old and start over from scratch - witness Chrysler and Ford over the last two decades.  As such, our products are usually stylish and inventive, but not very refined - see minivans, SUV's, cab-forward, night-vision, etc..The Japanese by comparison have a culture that is traditional and thousands of years old.  They have made an entire culture out of honoring tradition and the status quo.  We had to yank them kicking and screaming into the 20th century after world war II.  I know this is somewhat simplistic, but bear with me.  What the Japanese are good at is taking an idea and refining it year after year, until it is near perfect.  There is very little innovation or risk taking.  That is why the cars are so bland.  When was the last time you saw a new technology invented in Japan?  VCR's, computer technology, cell phones, the microwave oven...all American inventions that are better built by the Japanese.  The same goes for cars.  Most innovations come from the US or Germany, with some safety innovations coming from Scandinavia (give up the turbos and 5-cylinders, already those are as refined as they're going to get!).Anyway,...when you distill it down to its essence, this is why Toyotas and Hondas never break.  Its also why they are no more than transportation appliances.  And, this is why the best performance cars from Japan will always be knock-offs (albeit sometimes very good ones) of something somebody else does better and more originally.I'll step off my soap box now, and await your wailing."
50,"April 27, 2002  9:54PM",wishnhigh1,"The problem is that they are HUGE generalizations. Also, you are talking Japanese as almost exclusivly Honda and Toyota. What about Subaru, Mazda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu, and Suzuki? So far the only makes that seem to keep with that Japanese Culture are Toyota and Honda. And many American and European makes are now capable of having higher quality than more than 70% of Japanese cars. Doesn't help your generalization that much, does it?So where do the generalizations stop? They should stop with brands, and not nations."
51,"April 28, 2002  2:38AM",kd6aw1,"Have found out that with some of the more powerful cars like the G35 or Corvette the difference in performance from a practical standpoint isn't really an issue because these cars are faster than we can ever dream of driving without either killing ourselves or getting tickets all the time.

58,"May 28, 2002  2:50PM",rayainsw,"I beg to differ.While I admit that I am biased (obviously, since I bought one!) I believe that the W8 is really a performance sedan.I test drove the G35, and several BMWs (and a few others) before making my final choice.  I suppose the term &#145;performance sedan&#146; could be defined in any number of ways.  For me, the W8 offers everything I want &#150; and nothing I don&#146;t.(Isn&#146;t that a recent Nissan &#145;tag line&#146;?)Take straight line acceleration, for instance.  VW literature quotes 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec.  To me, this is pretty quick for a 4 door sedan.  My fearless (?) prediction of future test acceleration numbers is:  0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec., as VW claims.  And a quarter mile in about 15.0 at 94 / 95.  I base this on a number of things.  For instance, in the May 2000 Car and Driver comparison that included the Lincoln LS8 Sport and the Audi A6 2.7TT, the Audi tested had virtually identical curb weight as the W8, identical final drive, wheel / tire size and Tiptronic.  The HP / TQ for this Audi were 250 / 258.  And their test results were: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.6 sec. and the quarter mile in 15.1 at 94.  Thus, my W8 with 270 / 273 ought to do slightly better.  We&#146;ll see. . .  (BTW: in the same test, the Lincoln LS8 Sport they tested turned in acceleration numbers of: 0 &#150; 60 in 7.5 and the quarter mile in 15.7 at 90.  This was my previous car.  So, it seems reasonable that my W8 feels quicker &#150; setting aside the notorious un-reliability of everyone&#146;s &#145;butt dyno&#146;!)Does it pull the same lateral G as the G35 or a BMW 3 series w/Sport Package.  Almost certainly no.  But with more aggressive rubber, I expect that it will provide enough grip for entertainment value at any sane public road speed.

The CTS i drove was a 5 speed sport model with a sticker of 38k (gasp!).  The tranny was rough, very rough, almost Mustang bad.  The interior felt cheap with lots of hard plastic and very little in the way of substantial or soft-touch materials.  The throttle response was weak and required excessive modulation of a rather awkward gas pedal.  The car's a rolling bed of 1998 technology, no automatic brake distribution for one thing.  The salesmen kept insisting 4 channel ABS is impressive...to each his own.  Handling?  Nothing at all like the claims car mags are making.

69,"June 28, 2002  4:10AM",jagboyxtype,"I came to a different conclusion about the Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 and the Audi A4 3.0 Quattro.  I was considering both vehicles, and it was very close, but the Jaguar won for me.ACCELERATION:In acceleration times, the Jaguar is clearly faster than the Audi.  Car&Driver states of the X-TYPE, ""Subjectively, the X-TYPE didn't feel quite as quick as a BMW 330i.  But a few instrumented acceleration runs revealed that the measured 0-to-60-mph time of 6.3 seconds was only 0.2 seconds slower than the small BMW.  We would rate the smoothness of the X-TYPE's V-6 to be similarly close to that of the Bavarian in-line six.""Road&Track says of the X-TYPE's performance, ""In acceleration, the 3.0 X-TYPE is among the quickest.  Accompanied by a nice-but-distant exhaust note, the Jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer Lexus IS 300's and Audi A4's 7.1, the Mercedes C320's 6.8 sec. and matching the BMW 330i's time.""-Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 acceleration times: 6.3 - 6.5 sec*.-Audi A4 3.0 Quattro acceleration time: 7.1 sec*.* = manual transmission.HANDLING:Of how the cars handle, R&T says of the X-TYPE, ""Whether the chassis is redolent of Jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn't work.  It feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners.  Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkietalkies we all carry and said, 'This thing is really good in the curves!'  It's a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in.  The engine is not bad either.  Our test car's optional 3.0-liter 4-cam V-6 (there's a less expensive 2.5 version as well) put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort.""  They also say of its suspension, ""Jaguar engineers told us they wanted the suspension to be 'connected but relaxed,'and that seems to wrap it up nicely.  The ride is about as smooth as you'll find in this class, even with the Sport suspension.  Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivers surprisingly good handling.""Of the Audi's handling, they say, ""Dynamically, the all-wheel-drive car is not as crisp as it looks.  It handles well enough and has a superb highway ride, but it accomplishes these goals in a rather soft and rubbery style of suspension tuning and steering...In short, the Audi is missing that firm, rally-car edge and sense of steering precision that makes the BMW, for instance, so delightful to drive.  It's a car that can keep up with the other sports sedans, but doesn't feel very sporty doing it, despite our car's having the optional sport suspension for $750...We noticed in some of the whoop-de-dos and curves of our desert highway that the Audi produced 'considerable excitement,' as one driver put it, and was simply more floaty and loose than the others.  And again, 'This is where you pay for that great highway ride,' one driver noted.  The 3.0-liter 220-bhp dohc aluminum V-6 is smooth and reasonably peppy, though well back from the front of this pack.""STEERING:Motor Trend says of the X-TYPE's ZF Servotronic II variable-ratio speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system, ""The car's best system may be its speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering.  In fact, it matches the previously unrivaled precision served up by BMW 3 Series.  Car placement feels laser-guided precise, with excellent feedback and road feel.  With complete confidence and comfort, we drove at most times with just our fingertips - even at 120 mph on the track.  The only all-wheel-drive car we've ever driven offering similar levels of steering communication is the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a pretty racy piece.""The Audi's steering was criticized again by Car & Driver and Road & Track for being, ""rubbery"" in feeling, and C&D said that the ""steering wheel vibrates at peak engine revs.""Car&Driver also says that the steering system of the X-TYPE ""is nothing short of terrific.""  They call it ""enthusiast goods"".Forbes even takes note of the steering system in the X, ""Jaguar engineers boast it's the best steering system they've ever had on any model.  We agree.""ALL-WHEEL-DRIVE:Audi is known for its Quattro AWD system, which has been develped for over 22 years now.  Quattro IV its newest version, and is used on the A4.  It divides power 50/50 to the front and rear wheels unless slip is detected, and is known to be one of the best systems available.  Torque steer is said to be very minor, and it is said to work well with even the turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder versions of the A4, although it is noted by some to feel heavy without the larger V6.  Audi also used Quattro to prove that AWD in certain racing conditions could be better than other setups, and later was banned from using AWD cars in certain races because of its advantages.Jaguar uses a new AWD system they designed called Traction 4, which divides torque 40% to the front wheels, and 60% to the rear unless slip is detected.  This, along with specially designed roller bearings fitted between the tops of the front strut towers and the body, along with its advanced steering mechanism, give the performance and feel of a RWD car.  Unlike most AWD systems, Car&Driver said that Traction 4 produces no torque steer to interphere with the purity of the steering.Forbes stated of the X-TYPE's AWD, ""The X-TYPE gets a seemless, virtually transparent new 40/60 viscous coupling all-wheel-drive system with optional dynamic stability control that rivals Audi's vaunted Quattro for wet- and dry- weather grip.""Road&Track said that, ""...The Jag is better balanced.  It will understeer during turn-in, take something of a set, and then pull you through.  It's a safe and secure feeling that signals what's about to happen and gives you plenty of time to adjust""BRAKING:The X-TYPE features the same vented front and solid rear discs as found on the larger S-TYPE.Road & Track said, ""In braking tests, the X-TYPE had impressive and easily repeatable stopping distances from 60 mph (118 ft.) and 80 mph (208 ft.)""  In another one of their articles, they say, ""The braking distances turned by the X-TYPE are exceptional, comparable to those of top sports cars.""Car & Driver also said, ""A few laps at the Castle Combe racetrack allowed us to explore the outer reaches of the X-TYPE's handling, where it proved completely benign, thanks to the all-wheel-drive.  Even at the limit, understeer never grinds the front tires excessively, but the only way to get the tail out was to flick the steering wheel while simultaneously lifting the throttle.  The four-wheel disc brakes proved linear and powerful under repeated heavy track use.""By comparison, a BMW M-Roadster stops from 60 mph in the same 118 feet as the Jag.  The Porsche 911 GT2 stops from 60 just two feet shorter than the Jag, at 116 feet.  An SLK32 AMG does"

The Jaguar goes for the warm-looking British cabin that its family members also display, utilizing massive amounts of wood and Conolly leather with bits of chrome; the Audi has a German, functional design that is still inviting with clean lines and details.  I really like the interiors of both cars.  The Jaguar has the best leather and wood, but a few things like the plastic of the Audi's air vents seems more resilient, etc.Road&Track said that, ""Despite the lower-than-XJ price, the X-TYPE sports the traditional Jaguar upscale cabin...The simple round gauges have an easy-on-the-eyes green backing on the instrument faces, there's birds-eye maple trim scattered around the cockpit, and the seats are tasteful and comfortable...The Jag's interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges.""  They say it ""may be an 'entry level' model, but you wouldn't know it judging by all that leather, wood, and the easy to use nav system.""Motor Trend says the X-TYPE ""has great styling inside and out"", and says specifically that the interior is ""soothing, luxurious, and reasonably sound from an ergonomic standpoint.  The main instruments are nicely detailed and easily readable through the steering wheel.  HVAC and audio-system controls are housed in a centrally mounted horseshoe-shaped binnacle, which allows lots of genuine maple veneer to span the entire dash...It's pure Jag inside and out.""Car&Driver says ""As you'd expect, the interior is lined in sumptuous Connolly leather and bird's-eye maple wood trim on the dashboard and doors.  Luxury amenities abound, as well as the expected front, side, and head airbags...The level of finish is very nice with neat stitiching, close fits, and excellent materials throughout.""_____________________________eaweg-My opinion is that the Audi and the Jaguar are both great cars, but that the Jaguar offers more.  It is more expensive than the A4, but it is more expensive for a reason.  It is known to outhandle the A4 and outperform it in acceleration and braking, and it has the most rigid chassis in its class, 30% more than the previous class leader.  AWD is also standard, as well as Connolly leather and wood.  You must have had a bad test car if yours felt like it was going to fall apart, because everything I have read and experienced with the X-TYPE says that it is very solid with high-quality materials throughout.  Like you said, to each their own."
71,"June 28, 2002  6:54AM",blueguydotcom,you can lease an X-type for next to nothing...high incentives.
72,"June 28, 2002  1:02PM",eaweg,"Thanks for the response...I too have read all of the magazines...I love automobile literature! At the sametime I have come to realize how much biased opinion there is (and maybe payoffs?   )Anyhow, I would agree with you that so far all of the statistics that have come back point to the Jag leading in numbers...well so does BMW and the G35.  I was really interested in the x-type whenit came out.  It does look quite beautiful.  Howerver, I test drove not only one but two.  Same opinion.  Both felt like fast wheelbarrows.  I think you would agree that what it comes down to is personal preferance...I just didn't 'feel' right with the x-type.  The BMW I tested I liked quite a bit and it was a tough decision.  I have to be honest and say that it was the 'Quattro' that won me over as well as the excellent lease deal.  My lease on the Audi was much better than that on the x-type as well.  I think that you would also agree that not everyone is going to get a 'perfect car' off the lot (even though we all should).  Every car is going to have its minor (and unfortunately some major) problems.  Fortunately for me (and hopefully you) I have had none.  What concerned me was the article I read from autoweek...""Quality problems bedevil Jaguar's X-Type; two drivetrain issues cited""...Jaguar Cars Ltd. is at risk of alienating its newest group of owners, many of whom complain their new X-Type sedans have an array of irritating quality snafus. While none of the problems directly affect safety or operation, they are of sufficient annoyance that some first-time Jaguar buyers say they're ready to bolt the franchise......There are two separate drivetrain problems. During deceleration from about 70 mph, a high-pitched whine will come from the all-wheel-drive differential unit. That problem is so widespread that Jaguar has issued a technical service bulletin to its U.S. dealers. The fix: adding mass to the differential-mounting bracket. But the cold weather noise is another matter. It occurs anywhere from 20 mph to 70 mph. For some owners it goes away quickly; others have the tuning-fork sound ringing for minutes at a time. This problem has been the most bothersome to owners because Jaguar Cars has not officially acknowledged it exists.

73,"June 28, 2002  1:04PM",eaweg,"Thanks for the response...I too have read all of the magazines...I love automobile literature! At the same time I have come to realize how much biased opinion there is (and maybe payoffs?   )Anyhow, I would agree with you that so far all of the statistics that have come back point to the Jag leading in numbers...well so does BMW and the G35.  I was really interested in the x-type when it came out.  It does look quite beautiful.  However, I test drove not only one but two.  Same opinion.  Both felt like fast wheelbarrows.  I think you would agree that what it comes down to is personal preferance...I just didn't 'feel' right with the x-type.  The BMW I tested I liked quite a bit and it was a tough decision.  I have to be honest and say that it was the 'Quattro' that won me over as well as the excellent lease deal.  My lease on the Audi was much better than that on the x-type as well.  I think that you would also agree that not everyone is going to get a 'perfect car' off the lot (even though we all should).  Every car is going to have its minor (and unfortunately some major) problems.  Fortunately for me (and hopefully you) I have had none.  What concerned me was the article I read from autoweek...""Quality problems bedevil Jaguar's X-Type; two drivetrain issues cited""...Jaguar Cars Ltd. is at risk of alienating its newest group of owners, many of whom complain their new X-Type sedans have an array of irritating quality snafus. While none of the problems directly affect safety or operation, they are of sufficient annoyance that some first-time Jaguar buyers say they're ready to bolt the franchise......There are two separate drivetrain problems. During deceleration from about 70 mph, a high-pitched whine will come from the all-wheel-drive differential unit. That problem is so widespread that Jaguar has issued a technical service bulletin to its U.S. dealers. The fix: adding mass to the differential-mounting bracket. But the cold weather noise is another matter. It occurs anywhere from 20 mph to 70 mph. For some owners it goes away quickly; others have the tuning-fork sound ringing for minutes at a time. This problem has been the most bothersome to owners because Jaguar Cars has not officially acknowledged it exists. Some owners say they have had several prop-shafts replaced under warranty - one American owner says he is on his sixth. Steven Miller, a 41-year-old attorney from Long Beach, N.Y., suffers from both drivetrain problems.

74,"June 28, 2002  4:41PM",cmnott,"Congrats on your A4! Look, no question you were quite gracious about my comments about the A4. I was so disappointed with the new styling because I always wanted the previous A4. So to see how it looks, personally, I hate it. maybe it is just me, but I just couldn't come to grips with it.I found the A4 felt slow reacting whereas the jag had better reflexes. but also felt smaller.  i think it is unfair and untrue to say the ""Ford"" thing, I think that has been addressed, whether people choose to beleive it or not.  The 6 speed was poor, there is no other word for it, but i really did enjoy the automatic (as far as one can).  the jaguar had a much, much better transmission but I was not particularly enamored with the clutch.  the steering, IMO, was better than almost all. I just couldn't justify the price difference when a certain car is TRYING to make an impression in a hot segment.Like i said before, there are no losers in this segment, but I think it is  safe to say none of us would go for the winner of the comparo, eaweg and jagxboytype!"
75,"June 28, 2002  6:39PM",jagboyxtype,"I totally agree that it is all personal preference, and I really believe that most all of the cars in this segment, especially the A4, S60, and X-TYPE, are some of the best.  I don't think there is ""a best"" car here since everyone has different needs and preferences.  They all have their own ups and downs, but I think the benefits of each of these cars certainly outweighs most of their negatives as well.On the X-TYPE article:I read that Autoweek article too, and it scared me a bit before I went to check out the X-TYPE and made me check the competition before going with the car in the end.  Jaguar seems to have solved most all of those problems in the current X-TYPEs though, and the ones being produced now don't have any of those problems.  I also found two articles in my local newspaper that were on early X-TYPE problems.  The initial article was much like the Autoweek one, and the second one came out a pretty long time after the first one; it was a follow-up on how those initially unhappy customers were doing after Jaguar North America finally contacted them and worked on their cars.  They had factory technicians go out and examine the cars and all of that - they even bought back a car and gave the owner a much better new one.  Jaguar was a bit late in contacting them (and I agree that it took too long), but they did get most all of their X-TYPEs fixed and the customers ended up being very pleased with their cars in the end.Yes, some of the very early production X-TYPEs lived up to their old Jaguar reputation for being problematic as the article shows, but the newer ones are much better both in quality and reliability.  Jaguar did many things and worked hard to correct the faults of the early cars, and they even had the Whitley Engineering Center, who designed the driveshafts for the X-TYPE, go through five or six different new designs until they finally got it perfect.I can personally say from experience that the X-TYPE is not in any way a problem car, at least the ones being produced now, especially as my own car has had no problems at all.  It initially had the drippy windshield whiper jets, but the dealership simply tightened a valve on the underside of the hood before giving me the car, and nothing has gone wrong since I've had it.  I really love even just being around the cars as it has been so good.Again, it is all personal preference.  When I sat in the Jag for the first time, it just felt right.  I hadn't even adjusted the seat and it just felt so perfect.  Every time I sit in it, everything is perfect.  The whole car is that way for me, and I bet your Audi is the same for you.And if anyone is paying off the media it's BMW and Infiniti, and it appears that Infiniti is paying the most.  I don't think Jag even has the funds to do that:-) (Although, global sales were just up 62% in April, and they've had record-setting sales for the past four consecutive years now.)And, it is very nice to speak to someone civilized on this board.  Take care of your car!____________________________Blueguydotcom-I actually own my car, we paid the dealer in full when we got it.  The only incentive for the X-TYPE is a pretty good lease price (I just checked yesterday), but even that has been complained about and called false advertising by many as it is only for the 2.5 litre model with no options (not even paint is included in the advertized price for the lease!).  It's also ending in a few months, and then prices will be even higher.  I'd like to see how people complain about it being very expensive when the 2003 prices come out, as they are even higher than this year.  Oh well, it is a Jaguar after all, and a great car on its own.  Option packaging has been reorganized for 2003, however, so getting things like sunroofs is easier."

77,"June 29, 2002 12:48AM",jagboyxtype,"The X-TYPE is Jaguar's fastest selling car right now, it accounts for over half of all Jaguar's sales, and it has boosted Jaguar's global sales by 62% since January 2002; and that number was recorded from April.  In February of 2002, Jaguar's U.S. sales alone were up 105% compared to Feb. 2001, largely because of the X-TYPE.  X-TYPE's sales have been taking off after a slower start since the events of 9-11.Recorded in May, 16,171 X-TYPEs have been sold since January 1, 2002 in the U.S.  Of that number, 2,961 were sold in May.  Jaguar is very happy with its sales.  Also, the X-TYPE is supposed to be lower volume than many of its competators as it is a Jaguar.  Never the less, this compares well with 16,395 Audi A4s and 16,339 Volvo S60s sold so far this year.  The Infiniti G35 has only sold 8,731 units so far, and 11,237 Cadillac CTS's have been sold in 2002 as well."

For those who get the G35, more power to you...so you can beat me in a straight line...if racing was what I wanted I would have gotten a used S4 and modded it to about 340hp...but I really couldn't see myself doing that for at least the next 4 years of my life.  For some reason I have a sneaking suspicion that something negative is going to come out about the G35...I just can't pinpoint it thought.  The '02+ 3 series are just plain ugly with the new facelifts.Cmnott, as for the 6 speed, yeah it was pretty ""odd"" the first couple of months.  I can honestly say though that it has brolen in and that it is worlds better than when I first got it.  To think that the 5spd manual in the 96 Saab 900se that I had before it was actually better!!

80,"July  2, 2002  7:05PM",jagboyxtype,"My point was that the X-TYPE is selling and that there is a larger amount of them on the road right now than there are G35's or CTS's.  Blueguydotcom had asked about its sales numbers and had compared how he had seen few X-TYPEs on the road but many more ""Bimmers, Lexuses, G35s and CTSes"".  I just threw in the other cars' numbers to demonstrate that although he may have seen more of some of the other cars, in actuality, there are more X-TYPEs that what he has seen.Also, Infiniti sold 3,298 G35's in May 2002.  Since its introduction in March, it has sold 8,731 units as recorded in May.  Assuming that around 3,298 units would have been sold in January and February had the car been introduced earlier and had a start in sales numbers for January 1 like the others, it would have sold about 15,327 units (3,298 + 3,298 + 8,731 = 15327)."

There are still IS300 coupe rumors, too.  To a lesser extent, the C-Class coupe takes on the compact 3-Series in Europe.And to top that off, the new Saab 9-3 is a sedan now with a normal trunk.By your thinking: ""You could almost include the Z3 roadster in the mix, as it shares engines, transmissions, and platform parts"", I guess we should include the Camry in the ES300's sales volume since they share those same parts too.

The 325, though, lacks even the most fundamental standard options (no power seats on a $30k+ car!?!?) and has a way to go on the interior design (cheesy exposed cup holders that look like they belong in a Pontiac).  Not to mention the 325 has 30% less power to spin those 4 wheels.The sad thing is that virtually all luxury sports sedan reviews compare a $40k+ loaded 330 with a $33k A4, and the 325 is declared the de facto winner as it rides on the tails of the 330.

I would like to see how it would handle if it were a midsize car (like the Infiniti G35 or Acura TL).The amount of 'points' that are giving to the BMW for it's handling should be removed for it's size.  This is a sedan!  It is not a sports car.  When talking about sedans, sufficient room in the car should be seen as an important factor.I'm sure they could make the BMW even smaller and get even better handling and performance from it.  If they did that, it would be hard to justify it even being in this category."
92,"September 15, 2002  3:18AM",kdshapiro,"rp - you are correct the 330i is a sedan, just like the G35, just like the Acura, just like the Audi and all of the cars that were compared in the latest Edmunds round-up. None of them are sports cars. Edmunds calls them Entry Level Luxury Sport Sedans. The fact is the 530i also gets very high marks in the performance department, except the 530i is a true Luxury Sport Sedan, again not a sports car.Now the 530i outclasses all of the above in terms of amenities, but it would be interesting to see from a strict performance viewpoint, how it compares to the above or even compares to the 330i.Although in the scheme of things size has little to do with performance - as another poster pointed out there are cars the same size as the 330i that are nowhere near it in terms of overall performance. Note the salient word is overall.Also the fact that it is a compact has nothing to do with it's interior room. The G does not have marginally much more room and if you read Edmunds round-up, it does state there is sufficient room in the car for 4 adults in the 330i. Unless you regularly transport 5 people and the two people in the back seat absolutely have to have the reclining seats, in my opinion the amount of extra space in the G doesn't make that much of a difference. It might to you, but then you get to vote with your dollars. If I regularly transported 5 people however, none of the cars in the Edmunds round-up would be on my list.It seems clear to me based on the reviews I've read over the last couple of years, when only talking about the sport of driving in this segment, the 330i is the benchmark."

Its pretty small and the price goes up fast as you add options, and its also underpowered for my taste.I've never driven the C240.

I chose a G35, but if you are a Honda fan or prefer FWD the TL-S is a great choice. It will also run you a little less than a comparably equipped G35, and you can probably get a deeper discount to boot. There have been concerns about the TL-S having tranny failures, but Acuras tend to be very reliable. For direct comparisons of the G35 and TL-S look at the recent Edmunds entry sport lux sedan comparo, the C/D currently on news stands (I have to admit its not very credible to me) and the July 2002 R/T.

Plus, it's a sports-sedan, so the engine is supposed to have a nice little note to it.  Many reviewers have enjoyed the sound the X-TYPE's engine makes.  There is also almost no wind noise as exterior mirrors, etc. were sculpted from windtunnel tests at Pininfarina and high-speed tests on the Nardo bowl in Italy as well as the Nurburgring in Germany.-Clutch: yes, some people dislike its feel, yet others like it because it is not difficult to use.  I believe that it was MotorWeek that stated it felt like a BMW clutch.-Pricing: you can get a base X-TYPE for around $29,000 - $30,000 with leather and wood, manual transmission, metallic paint, etc.  Option packages have been re-organized to allow more individual options to be ordered.  Competators like the MB C-Class sedan start at around $31,000 without leather and wood, but vinyl and plastic.About the only virtue the X-TYPE doesn't have are memory seats.  Beyond those, it's one hellofa car.  I doubt it would still be making up 56.7% of Jaguar's sales and dominating an unheard-of 66% of its market in Europe (especially Italy) if it weren't a great car.______________________________________On the Acura transmission problems, only 16,000 cars have been afficted with the problem over the past two years, according to the posted article.  Accura sells a lot of cars, so it does not seem to be a massive or wide-spread problem.  Hopefully they'll fix it, but I wouldn't worry about it too much."

I didn't write them.  Please don't shoot me.  I just passed along what an interesting source said.  I happen to agree with many of their comments.  Not all.  And I hope Jaguar works aggressively to improve the X-type.
109,"September 22, 2002  3:47AM",jagboyxtype,"""Please don't shoot me.""I wasn't trying to shoot you.  You are just being paranoid.  I never even mentioned you in my whole response except for in the title where I was directing my message to what had been said that you passed along.  I said ""they"" as in the editors of European Car, but if you are now using the ""royal we"" and took what I said as directed towards you, now you know that is not how it was meant.  I will shoot some words at you about improving the X-TYPE, however, as I don't feel the car needs any improving at all except in a very few minor areas, such as memory seats (not that they are really needed, but it would be a nice touch).  Everything that makes a Jag is there in the X-TYPE, and it is a great car on its own.  Naturally, Jaguar will improve the X-TYPE just as it improves all of its cars.  As for your fear of being shot at with words on this board, perhaps you shouldn't say things that would cause you to get shot at if that is a fear of yours.BTW, every month, over 3,000 people just in the U.S. disagree with you and with European Car about the X-TYPE.  Sorry buddy, but you're in the minority on this one.  However, European Car's own final words on their X-TYPE test were:""Pushed to the limit and the X-Type will gently push until you ease off the throttle. Muscled around the track however, and its possible to slide the sedan until the tires melt. Great fun!I came away from the X-Type totally surprised. I expected to find a meek and mild sedan but instead found a serious contender in the sport-sedan market. These first two offerings are great!...I can't wait to see what those rouges at Jag's R division have in store for the X-Type."""

Did you notice in your most recent post you did write ""over 3,000 people just in the US disagree with YOU and with European Car about the X-type.""Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written?  Or what MT and C&D have previously written?  The X-type has gotten mixed reviews at best in America.  Don't believe it has ""won"" a single comparison test.  See R&T's recent 11-car sport sedan comparison.  Think that says a ton when X-type falls short badly in comparison tests.Can you steer me to an American comparison test in which the X-type won?  And what do sales have to do with how truly good a sport sedan is?  I see a lot of people driving Malibu, Taurus, I30, ES300, etc.  To many (most!) people a car is either an appliance or a status symbol.  But it is only the rare few who are truly interested in all around performance.  Some people might argue that low sales are a better indicator.  Most people want cushy ride on interstate, not 0-60 times or slalom results.  The IS300 crowd might wear their low sales as a badge of honor."
112,"September 22, 2002  1:26PM",riez,"jagboyxtype...  Do you read MT or R&T?Check out the November 2001 issue of Motor Trend.  MT pans the X-type 3.0 AUTOMATIC in their 5-car comparison.  In 10 areas of their ""Report Card"", the Jag wins just one, styling.  Has last place or 2nd to last place rating in powertrain, ride, interior design, seat comfort/support, rear-cabin space, trunk useability, and value.  Track results mediocre.  Fourth place 0-60 mph time.  2nd slowest slalom time.  Worst braking result.  They tested a moderately loaded $43,695 one.Check out the July 2002 issue of Road & Track.  R&T pans the X-type 3.0 MANUAL in their 11-car comparison.  X-type comes in 10th overall, 9th in just subjective ratings, and 10th in just performance ratings.  They tested a loaded $46,510 one.Does that mean you disagree with me, European Car, R&T, and MT?  Wonder if you and the other 3,000 people are reading what is out there?

C&D's X-type was pretty basic, with only a $39,170 MSRP.  Notice the trend, all the tested X-type's had stickers of $39,000 and up, and most publications harp that the Jag fails to deliver the goods for so many dollars.Pushing $40,000 does NOT seem to be entry-level to me.

116,"September 23, 2002 10:52AM",jagboyxtype,"Merc1-The X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader, the BMW 3-Series.  You may check out AutoWeek's review of the car for that information, as well as a review on the site autobytel.com and reviews conducted by Autocar including their ""Autocar Book"" all about the X-TYPE.  I never said that any of those cars you mentioned didn't have very solid and rigid structures nor did I try to imply that, but at the moment, the Jaguar has the most rigid structure in its class.Also, as riez would say, ""I did not write the article"".  The reviewers were the ones who said all of those quotes about the X-TYPE beating the C-Class in every part of that test, and not just acceleration times.  Take braking (""top drawer"" for the X-TYPE), or how they said the cars felt when being driven.____________________________________Riez-I pity you, because you only believe what car magazines tell you, and you allow them to choose for you what is best instead of collecting your own information and actually checking things out for yourself.  Listen to what you've been sayin: ""Car & Driver said this, and MotorTrend said this, and Road & Track said this"".  Granted, I have used their quotes and stats many times to back my own opinions as well (which I even do here), but you've taken it to an extreme.""Do you read MT or R&T?"" you ask me.Sometimes I do, but only for entertainment purposes.  Why?  Because I do not trust them, do not believe everything they say, and only take what they have to say as their own human opinions.  And I am not the only one who feels that way.  ABC News, for instance, did an investigation on the subject of car magazines being biased and omitting facts to suit their own interests.  They use the Ford Focus and Car&Driver and MotorTrend's opinions of the car as an example:""For example, in January, Car and Driver listed the Ford Focus among its '10 Best Cars of the Year.' It never mentioned that Ford had recalled the Focus eight times for various problems when that review was written [one such recall was because the wheels would fall off of the car!]. Also, just this month, when Motor Trend's review came out — no mention of the recalls or the fact that the government has five ongoing safety-related investigations of the Focus. (It currently has six ongoing investigations, but only five that Motor Trend could have known of when it went to press.)""http://www.abcnews.comHmmm.  Six government safety investigations, eight major recalls in its few years of production, and the Focus is a favorite among car magazines like Car&Driver and MotorTrend.  Well, they can have it, and I'm sure you think it's a wonderful little car since everything they say suddenly becomes law for you.ABC also mentions how certain car manufacturers that give all-expense paid trips to reviewers get higher scores and better reviews when the reviewers handle their cars.  Even an auto reviewer interviewed in the article said ""there are other subtle ways that automakers try to woo the press"".  MotorTrend's own C. Van Tune admitted to utilizing these perks from certain auto makers although his magazine has the resources to pay for these trips, etc. on its own.The warning at the end of the article reads: ""So far, the big magazines don't seem to have changed their policies. So, be aware: When you read and see reviews of this year's models, some of those reviews were written by reporters who've been fed and fueled by the car companies.""It can be expected that comparison tests would be especially succeptible to the effects of biases and perks from some automakers.  This is why you cannot believe and trust car magazines for anything more than entertainment and a very few facts.""Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written? Or what MT and C&D have previously written?"" you also ask me.  Yes, I have.  European Car's own review of the X-TYPE is nothing short of pure flattery towards the car.  Road&Track's review of the X-TYPE is also very complementary.  Car&Driver tested the X-TYPE's 0 - 60 time as just 6.3 seconds and raved about ""enthusiast goods"" of the car.  MotorTrend enjoyed the car very much, and bought their own long-term tester, of which they say ""This new X is one shaggy Jaggy"" and ""I'm anxious to try out the upcoming R version of the X-TYPE, because this is a very good sport sedan"".  AutoWeek liked the car and decided that ""X"" was definitely an addition to the ""A"", ""C"", and ""3"" in the sport sedan equation.  Forbes wrote a very fine review of the car.  A vast majority of other reviews, such as those at carpoint and autobytel are also complementary to the X-TYPE.  And again, Autocar was so inspired that they created a minibook about the ""Most Important Jaguar Ever"" and said that between it and a 330i, they don't know which one they would choose - ""it's that close"".You mention ""American"" tests in your posts.  I must also ask you, however, why you believe that any reviews or comparison tests about the X-TYPE from any other parts of the world are suddenly invalid?  They are all reviews, how come only the ones you choose count?  There are people from all over the world here at Edmunds, are their views and opinions also invalid to you because they do not live in the same country as you do?On the matter of that Road&Track 11 car comparison, the reviewers say:""So how, you ask, did a car as nice as the Jaguar X-TYPE end up second to last in this great big comparison test?  That's easy: Price.""Notice that they happened to also have loaded their X-TYPE with every option available on the car including such expensive items as the navigation system, weather package, and premium sound system, etc.  Yet, other cars in their test were not fully loaded as the Jaguar was.  The BMW, for instance, was lacking its navigation system and other items, the Mercedes-Benz (the second most expensive car in the group at $44,949) also without its navigation system and lacking its premium sound system (and in fact left without a CD player that no one seems to complain about not having in this car for this price, where as the Jaguar can take heat for having just a single-disc indash unit when not equipped with the 6-disc changer).  A test with price included is not valid unless all cars are optioned out with the same equipment.  The X-TYPE had much more than any of the other cars in the test did.  A better comparison for price would have been to compare base prices of the cars or prices of options, or get this: equip the cars similarly.  Take note that both the Saab and the Mercedes-Benz have higher starting prices than the Jaguar, and that the Jag's starting price is about $1,500-$2,000 above most of the other cars in the test, and that it comes standard with wood and leather which costs about $1,500-$2,000 to equip on the other cars.  AWD is also standard on the Jag, and extra-cost options on the cars that can have it equipped.  La"

It's a little higher than that $40K estimate of yours.  My point is not to single out the 3 for high pricing, but to demonstrate that while a nicely equipped one can be had for around $40,000, like any other car in its class, it carries a high price when totally fully loaded.  This is my point about the X-TYPE in the 11 car R&T comparison: a nicely equipped one (similarly equipped with that $40,000 3 in the test) can be had for around $40,000, but the editors instead chose to get a totally fully loaded one and then mark it down for a high price.  It wasn't quite fair.  Totally fully loaded, the Mercedes-Benz would have been the most expensive car in the test by quite a margin.  Ever notice how the E-Class starts at around $50,000, but the S-TYPE and 5-Series start at around $42,000?As far as class leaders go, I believe that all of the cars in this class are very good, and that they target slightly different groups.  X-TYPE and C-Class have more luxury than the others, G35 and 3-Series are a little more performance oriented, but all of them share many traits with slight variances in the degrees of those traits.It's nice to hear from you!

119,"September 23, 2002  1:40PM",riez,"jagboyxtype...  I merely pointed out how when the American automotive press has had a chance to test the X-type up against its main competitors, it falls flat.  Pretty much every single American comparison test.Why do I bring up American tests?  Because I cannot buy a Euro-spec X-type in America. And many of the European cars a Euro-spec X-type is compared against in these tests aren't even sold in America.   Besides marques like Fiat, SEAT, Alfa, Lancia, etc.  Heck I can't even spell the French marques that are no longer sold in USA: Renault and Peugueot.  Been so long since since I've even seen an old French-marque car in my neighborhood.  So ensuring all the cars are USA-spec is critical to a legitimate comparison.And I've always loved the pro-Brit bias in the English car magazines.  They do whatever they can to say nice things about English cars.  I leaf thru their mags at my local Borders and Barnes & Noble.  The German press has raved about the underlying Ford Mondeo platform.  Mondeo built in Germany."

As far as that test goes, I think it was basically set up to show up any weakness the C320 may have.I don't think a 1/2 second is stomping anything into the ground, and the Jag should have been faster considering it was a manual.   Beating the C-Class at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn't what the car focuses on primarily.   I'd be more impressed with a ""pumeling"" by the X-Type of the 330i or IS300 in those areas.

C-Class review was also a little ""BS""-ed, however, I believe all comparison reviews are either a little biased or include some BS, as you can read about in my long posts a few messages away. However...You say ""Beating the C-Class at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn't what the car focuses on primarily.""Isn't the C-Class supposed to compete with the IS300, 330i, and X-TYPE?  Why is it that when the X-TYPE does win, excuses can be made for the other car(s), with ""they don't focus on those areas""?  I'm willing to invalidate the transmissions in the this test as they were not totally evenly matched there, but the X-TYPE won out every other category of the test as well: Engine, brakes, ride... I could just as easily say that the X-TYPE doesn't focus on those areas either, but no one would back me and it really is a poor excuse.  You also note that 1/2 second is not ""stomping anything to the ground"", yet in the Road&Track 11-car test, the X-TYPE was just 0.6 second slower than the fastest car in the test, and it was marked down for that.  We can't suddenly make an exception for this test.  I could say that the X-TYPE doesn't focus on acceleration in the R&T review, but again that is a poor excuse.  If we choose to accept the R&T 11 car test, then we must, by principle, accept this test as well.  In those regards, the X-TYPE v. C-Class comparison was quite valid.Take care!__________________________________Riez-I think I'll terminate this discourse now that we have both had our say.  It's just going to continue in a perpetual loop if we don't stop. But...I noticed that you still say the car falls flat, and in all of those comparisons, you have said yourself that price was a major factor in the car's losing points, as well as R&T, C&D, and others noting that.  I'm just wondering if you read my really long message a ways back, as I outlined how the X-TYPE in all of those tests was outfitted much more heavily with options than any of the other cars and that its price would have been closer to the others had the X-TYPE been outfitted with the same options as the others in the test.  Also, as merc1 notes, 1/2 second differences, etc. are not large gaps.  Being 0.6 second off from the fastest car in the test, and 0.5 from the winning car is not ""falling flat"" by any means.You seem to fail to notice actual measurements and what the reviewers write about the cars, and instead only look at points and scores.  Take note of the ""luggage space"" scores for the cars in the R&T 11 car test, for instance.  The X-TYPE has a boot capacity of 16.0 cubic feet.  For that, it received 7.8 out of 10 possible points in that category.  Now look at the Cadillac CTS with a boot capacity of 12.8 cubic feet.  Yet it received 8.4 points out of the 10, and it had a smaller boot.  The Infiniti G35 has 14.8 cubic feet of boot space, yet even with less space than the X-TYPE, it received the same score of 7.8 out of 10.  The 330i, with only 10.7 cubic feet of boot space received 7.6 points, only 0.2 less point than the X-TYPE with 5.3 more cubic feet than the 330i.  These ratios aren't right, and I cannot help but feel that their other points and scores must also be affected by these kinds of discrepancies.I also still disagree with you about European or other comparison tests not being valid.  Included in these tests are cars such as the X-TYPE, C-Class, and A4, et al, that are sold in the U.S., as well as cars that are not available here.  Just because a car is not U.S.-spec doesn't mean the test is totally invalid.  In those other countries especially, those tests are very valid (as far as comparison tests go).  It is not a question of whether or not the test is valid just to you, rather, it is a matter of how valid the test is as a fair test.  That's where the problem is, you are choosing which tests you want to acknowledge and which you simply feel like leaving out.  Besides, the difference between a U.S.-spec car and a non-U.S.-spec car is not going to come out in the test unless the car is crash tested or has an engine choice unavailable in the U.S., etc.  You can get a general idea still, and to simply say that because it is not a test conducted by an American magazine is a bit ignorant.  Especially as all of these cars are global cars.You also claim that English reviews have a bias towards British cars and that the Germans also are biased.  However, I have found that those two groups especially are very picky about cars and will tear a car apart worse than any American reviewer would dare to.  The British also have a thing for BMW's - a German car - and I've not found a review where they had a bias for Jaguar or any other British car, and if they were biased and I missed it, they certainly could not be any more biased than any American editors.Perhaps you have not noticed the bias that American reviewers have for German and Japanese cars?  I believe Edmunds stated something about their ""infatuation"" with ""everything German"" in a Mercedes review, and the idea that Japanese cars are so much more reliable than any other cars is also overplayed to the point of now being a bias of American writers (and don't attempt to say that I'm saying that Japanese cars are not reliable now, because they are, I'm simply pointing out that there is an American bias of believing that they are tremendously more reliable than any other kind of car)."
125,"September 24, 2002  1:57PM",jagboyxtype,"kdshapiro-You said ""I don't know what car you speced out but it's not my car. I don't deem a Nav system a must on a fully loaded car.

If you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that's your call.""That's exactly what I was trying to prove about the X-TYPE in its tests.  Take, for instance, the Road&Track 11 car comparo.  The X-TYPE had every option available including the unnecessary navigation system and other equipment that the majority of other cars did not have.  It has been that way in almost every comparison test: the editors choose a fully loaded (as in every single available option) X-TYPE and then mark the car down for being expensive in comparison to competitors that are not fully loaded.You are totally correct, NO ONE ever totally and fully loads out their car with every available option, but the reviewers all do for the X-TYPE in its comparison tests.  They don't for the other cars.  Even that second-most-expensive-car in the test C320 Sport was still not fully loaded, it didn't even have a CD player, as I mentioned before in my other message.  In the magazines, they depict the X-TYPE as costing $46,000 all of the time.   A base X-TYPE 2.5 with standard Connoly leather, wood trim, and manual transmission can be had at $29,000.  Make the car a 3.0 litre model, and you get everything in the base model plus standard indash CD player and other goodies, and your choice of manual or automatic transmission at no extra cost, for $35,000.  Nicely equipped, a 2.5 is usually around $33,000.  A nicely equipped 3.0 is around $38,000.In my other message, I wasn't trying to talk about your car.  I was using the 3-Series as an example of how in the tests they'll get a nicely equipped one at $39,000 - $40,000, but that the car's fully loaded price is $45,000, just as they only showed the X-TYPE's fully loaded price of about $46,000, when one that is nicely equipped is between $38,000 - $40,000 just like the other cars."
126,"September 24, 2002  5:28PM",kdshapiro,Okay I missed the point that particular car left nothing out in the options category. Most people do not buy a car like that.
127,"September 24, 2002  7:35PM",riez,"jagboyxtype...  Maybe we'll have something to discourse about when Ford improves the future Mondeo X-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class.  As it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan.  Sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat.  But I don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space.  And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges.  (Oops, think I meant to say when Jag improves the future X-type.    )And I'll really, really start worrying about and paying attention to European magazine results when Euro-spec cars are sold here.  But today I can NOT even buy them.  Think you should keep in mind that they often have many differences with their American counterparts (e.g., safety equipment, engines--they love diesels, transmissions) and there are tons of marques in Europe that are absent in America (Alfa, Fiat, Lancia, SEAT, Renault, Peugeout, Skoda, etc.)"
128,"September 25, 2002 12:58AM",jagboyxtype,"Riez-You missed the target again.  The trunk space example was simply an example of how the points awarded to certain aspects of the cars in the tests do not tell the whole truth, as you misguidedly seem to believe.  The fact of the matter is that the X-TYPE had more boot space than the other cars I mentioned, and it recieved less points than they did and in an unbalanced ratio, and that other scoring categories were similarly affected.  You also failed to notice the phrases ""For example"" and ""For instance"" leading into what I was saying in many cases if you believe that boot space was all that I was speaking about.  You said of the X-TYPE's large boot ""And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges.""From this I can tell that you never actually take the time to examine a car for yourself before passing judgement on it, but instead rely completely upon little comparison test articles and your own assumptions, as the X-TYPE does have multi-link boot hinges as opposed to the swan-neck hinges on such cars as the XJ8 and ES300, ect. that you assumed it had, and then stated it had as if it were a fact.  But what can I expect from someone who finds himself clever at falsely mistaking a car for one with which it shares a few parts that cannot even be seen?And on that topic, in the global car world of today, every car shares parts with another or many others.  *FOR EXAMPLE* (<--if you miss it this time, I don't know what to do), BMW uses General Motors-sourced automatic transmissions and parts are shared with Mini.  Volkswagen and Audi, Seat, Skoda, Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti all share many <i>many parts.  DaimlerChrysler and Mercedes-Benz share some parts now too, as well as sharing parts with Hyundai and Mitsubishi.  Making fun of that seems, well, kind of pathetic - unless you have a weird sense of humor.  They share parts; yeah - so what?  It's not really relevant.And as I noted about reviews and comparisons from other countries, the cars do have some differences from U.S.-spec cars (as you and I had noted that engines can be different, etc.) but a general idea of the car can be had from those tests - as I had also said before in my other message.  Quite often, those tests even use the versions of the cars equipped with engines that are sold with them in the U.S., as we generally have the larger versions of the engines available to us.  If it's a diesel-engine test, they usually also have the whole test based upon that fact and will call it a ""Diesel Showdown!"" or something else to that same effect.  Again (for now the second time), you cannot simply invalidate a test because it was not conducted in America.  The cars we are disputing are not even built in America.  And many times, the versions of the cars used in the tests are for the most part equivalent to their U.S.-spec versions. Alpha Romeos, Fiats, Renaults, and Vauxhalls are not sold in America, and thus I understand saying that for use in America, their tests would be for the most part inconcequential; but Audis, Jaguars, BMWs, and Mercedes are all sold in the U.S. as well as foreign countries, and those foreign versions of the cars have little difference from their U.S.-spec versions as far as any test categories can gauge.  They never crash-test the cars in these comparisons, and as C. Van Tune pointed out in the ABC article about how reviewers are ""fed and fueled"" by certain car manufacturers, safety isn't an exciting enough category for these tests, so to those reviewers who write about them, it is irrelevant.  Safety equipment is usually the primary difference between U.S.-spec and foreign versions of the same cars, but that's not going to show-up in one of these car comparisons because they are not comprehensive enough at all to measure such things.  Yet it's not just foreign articles that you are saying are invalid, though.  You are just choosing the ones that back your arguement to the slightest degree, which again just a display of your ignorance.As well as the boot-hinge thing that you got wrong (remember, X-TYPE has the multi-link hinges with auto-opening gas struts, not swan-neck hinges), you also said that it had a cramped rear seat in comparison to its competators.  In comparison to a long-wheelbase Maybach, it is cramped, yes.  However, it has one of the larger rear seats in its class.  Not only is it larger than the BMW 3-Series' rear seat as well as the IS300's and A4's, but it is also larger than the midsize 5-Series' rear seat (but I'll admit not by that much compared to the 5).  In posts in other sections of the Town Hall, you defend how large the 5-Series' rear seat is and how comfortable it is for adult passengers as far as roominess goes, why do you call the X-TYPE's rear seat - which is even larger than the 5's - ""cramped"".  Is this yet ANOTHER ASSUMPTION that you made about the X-TYPE?By now I am sure that you have noticed that I have continually refered to things in this message that I have already spoken about in my other two posts addressed to you a few messages back.  I'm wondering if you really even read them since your arguements are always the same, and now you're even making outright assumptions.  No matter what I say and no matter how many facts I back my statements with, you seem to have your eyes closed to them and don't even take them into account.  Not only that, but your statements are generally incorrect and your assumptions don't even touch on facts or reality.And I'd say the best selling Jaguar in history is competative when it makes up 56.7% of Jaguar's U.S. sales and holds an astonishing 66% of the entry-level to mid luxury segment in Europe, as well as over 70% of Jaguar's sales in its third largest market, Italy.  Was your statement about being competative just another assumption on your part?Maybe we'll actually have a discussion when you start taking note of what's actually going on with the car and stop making assumptions and false remarks.  Good day."
129,"September 25, 2002  6:27AM",merc1,"Ok, I read all that.  So I'm supposed to believe Jaguar's claim over what every other brand claims right?   Until I see an independent test of all of the cars in this class structural rigidity, I'll go by what feels the most solid, and it isn't the Jaguar X-Type.  So we disagree there.   Secondly, everyone knows full well that the C-Class is not on the same plane with the 330i and IS300 when it comes to being ""sporty"".   To impress me you'd have to beat those cars at all the track tests.  Beating a C320 at the track isn't hard, the IS300 and 330i rule there.   That acceleration test will never count in my book because of the trans difference.   I'm not saying the comparison as a whole was not valid, but I still maintain that they picked the areas in which the X-Type would winout.   And Lastly the X-Type has been ranked below the C in every OTHER comparo done.    If it were such a slaughter I'd think it would win some test over here too. M"
130,"September 25, 2002 12:40PM",riez,"jagboyxtype...  You should have more carefully read my post.  Did I specifically mention the X-type trunk (boot)?  No, I was discussing trunks in general.  And did you notice how I was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans?  Do you harp on such little things regarding the X-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors?  When you get creamed on the track and street, talk about the trunk?I don't care about sales figures.  What do they prove?  If we used that we'd all be driving a Camry or Accord 4-cyl sedan!As for Euro-land market, keep in mind two huge facts.  Currently about 40 percent of the cars sold there are diesels.  The ""hottest"" BMW is the 330id.  Can I buy that in USA?  NO!  And that over 80 percent of the cars sold there are manual transmission.  How many manual transmission diesel sedans, coupes, convertibles, etc. are sold in USA?  Be willing to bet the figure is about zero.  Ford Europe and Jag are rushing to get diesels into their Euro-products."
131,"September 26, 2002  2:24AM",jagboyxtype,"Riez-Again my point was that the boot space example was an example of how the points awarded in such comparison tests do not give real data.  Points and scores are skewed - or whatever adjective you would use to describe awarding more space with less points in a category that is all about having more space.""And did you notice how I was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans?""Yes, I did catch that phrase the first time I read it.  However, your argument against the X-TYPE in you message before the last was that it had a cramped rear seat and had swan-neck boot-lid hinges - both statements that were false.  And now your latest statement that you did not name the X-TYPE directly when speaking of such things as boot-space and rear-seat room really is a weak cover-up.You stated: ""Maybe we'll have something to discourse about when Ford improves the future Mondeo X-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class. As it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. Sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat.

And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit usability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges. (Oops, think I meant to say when Jag improves the future X-type.""Your argument was that you do not consider rear-seat room or trunk space when it comes to sport-sedans because those are two areas in which the X-TYPE excels.  If it had a small boot and a cramped back seat, then you would be attacking the car for those two points!  Then, to further attempt to deride the X-TYPE, you state that large boots, such as the X-TYPE has, often have space-intruding swan-neck hinges and odd opening shapes.  Of course you did not have to ""name"" the X-TYPE when making such statements - you implied it and did indeed name the car with the word, ""it"".  Why even mention space-intruding hinges if the X-TYPE does not have them?  Also, paragraphically, your topic was about the X-TYPE, and as those areas were spoken about there, they are directly linked to the X-TYPE.  However, your arguments were wrong, and to counter my catching of them being wrong, you are now stating that you were not speaking of the X-TYPE - a weak argument.  ""I don't care about sales figures. What do they prove?""You constantly say that the X-TYPE does not compete well against its competators.  Sales figures and how much of the car's manufacturer's sales the car makes are a direct indication of how well the car competes.  If the car did not compete well, then it would in turn have low sales figures and most probably not make up much of its manufacturer's sales.  The Camry and Accord 4-cylinder are not in the entry-level sport sedan class.  However, in their own class, it is generally accepted that they are very good cars.  Also, the ratio of new buyers of a new addition to an established market segment is an indication of how well the car competes, and over 90% of X-TYPE buyers are new customers to Jaguar.  That means that it is taking sales from competators that compete in that market segment - thus it is competing very well.If you have not gotten the fact that there are European comparison tests of cars that are sold here in slightly different forms but with the same engines as U.S.-spec versions, then it is just a show of your unwillingness to be reasonable to any degree.  I have stated that those cars are not exact doubles of their U.S. versions, but the ones outfitted with gasoline engines that are available in the U.S. and other such options are so much like their American versions that a comparison test is not going to be able to differentiate the two.  If there are differences measurable by the tests, then you can take them into account.  However, to invalidate the entire test is ignorant and unreasonable.""Do you harp on such little things regarding the X-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors?""No, I ""harp"" on such little things because YOU bring them up by making FALSE assumptions which you present as if they were facts.  Again, I used those ""little"" subjects as examples to prove my points because facts are a necessity in presenting the truth.  YOU are the one who decided to ""harp"" on my examples.Also, as I have stated and continue to have to remind you, the X-TYPE does not get beaten in the performance realm against competators.  EXAMPLES: the X-TYPE completely won an all-out performance test against the competing model from Mercedes-Benz, the C320 Sport.  It is a competing car.  Then, your so-very-important Road&Track even states: ""In acceleration, the 3.0 X-TYPE is among the quickest.  Accompanied by a nice-but-distance exhaust note, the Jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer Lexus IS 300's and Audi A4's 7.1, Mercedes-Benz C320's 6.8 sec. and matching the BWM 330i's time.  And remember the X-TYPE, like the Quattro, loses a tick off the line, because of a no-wheel spin launch with all-wheel-drive"".  According to your precious magazines, it also out brakes the Porsche 911 GT2 from 80 mph and stops just 2 feet shorter than the 911 GT2 from 60 mph.  That is real performance and if you try to argue that down, I believe I could safely say that it is a sign of a delusional mind.Perhaps you should stop simply reading my posts, but should actually begin synthesising the data as well.  I'm having a hard time responding to much of the outrageously false statements you've made thus far.You did get one thing right though.  Jaguar is getting diesel engines ready for the European market as they do make up for much of a manufacturer's sales there.  That was a weak point for the X-TYPE: it had no diesels to compete against the 330d etc. with the high gasoline prices in Europe.  Rest assured that when the engines are available, the X-TYPE will compete even better than it already does so well.  And when I'm on the track, I'll remember to mention my car's boot to the Porsche that I out-brake and to the IS 300, A4, C320 that I out accelerate and the BMW driver that I'm dead-locked with.  Even Road&Track took note of that."
132,"September 26, 2002  2:41AM",jagboyxtype,"Merc1-Other marques are not claiming that they have more rigid structures than the X-TYPE has because they do not.  You say that you'll go by what you feel feels more solid, however, I could just say that the X-TYPE feels more solid to me and say that the discussion is over.  Either way, we cannot do that.  AutoWeek had the measurements for structure rigidity in their article, and I even quoted them a little way back.  They also noted that the X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader's.  That means that the previous class leader no longer has the class-leading structure in rigidity because the X-TYPE, now the class leader in structural rigidity, beats it by 30%.  You are just choosing not to accept a fact.As for the X v. C article, you say that they chose to test in areas where the X-TYPE would win, but then wouldn't other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins?  The same can be said about any comparison.  Look at what is said in these articles, point-wise, the C-Class may win, however, in actual measurements, the X-TYPE beats it.  Take for instance what Road&Track said about acceleration, which I quoted above in my message to riez.Oh well, we don't agree on this one.  At least you have an open mind enough to at least read the articles, etc.  Whether you choose to believe what is said is you choice.  Have a nice day."

It being more rigid than the X-TYPE has not been mentioned in any reviews that I have seen as of yet, so I cannot say that the car is more rigid than the X's structure.  In many reviews, the editors have stated that the X-TYPE's structure is the class leader in measured rigidity, and as many reviews have concluded this, I accept the fact.  If the measurements of the A4's rigidity came out and proved to be higher than the X-TYPE's, then I would accept that, however, at this moment, the X-TYPE is known as the most rigid car in its class.This is not to say that the A4 has not surpassed the 3-Series in rigidity or possibly the X-TYPE, or to say that the car or any of the cars in this class are lacking in structural rigidity; it is simply to say that with the information available, all current measurements have proven the X-TYPE to be the most rigid to this day.""I always willing to read and listen hence our actual debating and not outright arguing.""Yes, thank you for being that way.

142,"September 28, 2002  2:01AM",linard,"Well, in any case, we don't know the exact figures for any of the cars in quantitative terms so we cannot make a complete judgement.  However, what I can judge with relative certainty are the crash test results for the X type, 3 series, C class and various other models which is related to structural stiffness and design.  From these results http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/summary_midlux.htm and http://euroncap.com/ratings.php3?id=large_family_cars&order=1 I am pretty certain that the C class has the best designed structure in it's class with the Jag being behind the 3 series and the A4.  The C class was one of only 2 cars in the EuroNCAP test to get a full 5 star rating and the C class is the highest rated midsize luxury car according the Insurance Institute.  The intrusion and deformation ratings are as follows...http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/grey_midlux.htm Anyway, if I had a choice on any of these cars, I'd save up my money and get an E class, but that's my personal opinion..."
143,"September 28, 2002  2:19AM",cybersol,"Actually, stiffness mainly determines how much a cars twists during quick handling maneuvers.Whereas, occupant protection arises from engineering to divert kinetic energy from the crash into crumple zones and away from the main passenger cabin.  The challenge is actually to get the stiff but crushable compromise correct.So stiffness equals good handling more than occupant protection."
144,"September 28, 2002  6:14AM",jagboyxtype,"Actually, this isn't the X-TYPE we have here in the U.S.
This is the X-TYPE section of the car crash test above:http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002Take note that this is the ""Jaguar X-Type 2.0 LHD"" marked under the ""Make, model and hand of drive"" portion of the chart at the bottom of the page.  The X-TYPE 2.0 is the low-end Europe-only version of the car that lacks the extra driveshaft that the 2.5 and 3.0 litre models have that are sold globally (as well as the driveshaft that is found in the 3-Series and C-Class).  Thus, its crash tests produce weaker results than the 2.5 and 3.0 versions, and 3-Series and C-Class, because 2.0 is a FWD car with no longitudal driveshaft that is found in AWD (X-TYPE) and RWD (C-Class, 3-Series) cars.Check out this site:http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/0210.htmIt notes that the X-TYPE underwent structural changes after December 2001 but does not say if that was a version-specific change (which I discovered it was).  A letter to Consumer Reports aided research, and their reply was as follows:""We spoke with JNA (Jaguar North America) on this question and they explained that the Jaguar X-Type was originally introduced in Europe as a 2.0 litre FWD (Front Wheel Drive) model. The only models sold in the U.S. are 2.5 and 3.0 liter AWD versions.... that achieve better frontal crash test results than the FWD European model due to a prop shaft that runs the length of the car from front to rear. The prop to the rear supplies power to the rear wheels as well as the front, which accounts for the AWD traction... The modifications made and referred to in IIHS's report on X-Types (made) after December 2001 were actually modifications made to FWD European models and are not applicable to the U.S. AWD models.""(Thanks ""JagDude"" and Consumer Reports for this information).Also note that the reason why the C-Class recieved a 5-star rating in the European test over the 4-star rating that all of the others in this class recieved was because it was the only car that had a flashing light that lit-up a sign reading the equivalent of ""fasten your seatbelt"" on its dash, which is to become a standard feature in Europe in the future(?).  It would have recieved that same 4-star rating had it not had the light.  This is straight off the site:""Extra points awarded for the way that the C-class reminds its passengers to buckle their seat belts have now made it the second car ever to gain a five-star crash protection rating. Results for the C-class were published last year and it achieved four stars. But Euro NCAP has since changed its scoring system to encourage car makers to fit seat-belt warnings.""All in all, I'd feel very safe in any one of the cars in this class, and I do feel safe being in one of them.  Stay safe everyone."
145,"September 29, 2002  5:58PM",linard,"I honestly cannot remember a car I've been in that HASN'T had a seatbelt warning light.  Our 87 Mercedes 420 SEL had it and my 99 Honda Prelude has it.  Maybe this is due to European influence as the Focus (originally introduced and designed in Europe) has an obnoxious system that beeps and chimes if the driver does not fasten within an allotted amount of time and other cars I've been in have ""sensed"" the weight of a passenger and have flashed the seatbelt light as well (I believe the LandCruiser does this).  However, as the seatbelt usage stats are dropping in the US, maybe this is a good idea after all.  I can personally attest my safety and my mother's life to seatbelts.BTW JagBoy, the EuroNCAP X-Type was a 2002 and it stated that the FWD 2.0 was released March of that year which is supported by both CAR and Top Gear Magazines (British publications).  In addition, I am relatively certain that the X-Type was introduced as an AWD model to differentiate it from the Mondeo and to keep it from alienating Jag owners who may have cringed at the thought of a FWD Jag (this is from a CAR article soon before the X-Type itself was introduced in May of 2001).  However, as the base 2.5 is an already relatively expensive car and does not fare well against a C180 or 318i in terms of value, Jag decided to introduce the FWD 2.0 with a stick as standard. From what I understand, the driveshaft does assist in distributing the crash impact rearward, however, the larger engine block of the 3.0 tends to push rearward earlier in an accident than the smaller block of the 2.0 with it's fewer driveline components (obviously as it is FWD) so the crumple zones of the 2.0 have more room to crumple.  I believe this is the reason why Mercedes decided to replace the 3.2 inline 6 of the E class with the smaller block of the 3.2 V6 in 99 and the difference in crash test scores between a 97 and a 00 are pretty significant although I'm not sure if Mercedes conducted any significant changes to the structure since they lowered the hood by an inch."
146,"October  1, 2002  4:28AM",jagboyxtype,"Yes, my X-TYPE also has a seatbelt warning light in the dash.  Most all cars do.  In addition, it chimes at you when you do not have your seatbelt on, and it has sensors in the seats that measure how much the occupant of the seat weighs and more sensors determine how far the occupants are from the dash and steering wheel so that it can calculate how much force to use when firing airbags in the event of a collision.  A small amber light in the corner of the wood veneer on the passenger's side lights up and displays whether the occupant there weighs enough for the airbag to be automatically turned on or off, and the seats automatically also turn off the airbags if a baby or childseat is detected.
The warning system in the Mercedes C-Class in that test was a different light from the ones we have in our cars here.  Notice that the C-Class  had scored a 4-star rating in the test just as all of the other cars in that class did, but because of the addition of another light that said ""put on your seatbelt"", the car's score was later changed to a 5 to promote more lights that say ""put on your seatbelt"" to be used in other cars.  I'm not saying that the C does not deserve a high rating in crash tests, but its additional star over the other cars in its class is simply because it has an additional light that tells passengers to wear their seatbelts on top of the light on the dash that says to wear your seatbelt.  It is not necessarily safer than the other cars because of that light, and so I do not believe that it should have gotten an entire extra star for a light.You are also wrong about the 3.0 Jaguar engine ""pushing"" into the cabin in a crash before the 2.5 and 2.0 because they are the same engine blocks but the 3.0 has been drilled-out more to be larger.  Also, the engines do not enter the cabins at any time in a crash because the X-TYPE is designed to ""drop"" its engine when it is in a severe frontal crash.  Most modern cars do this.  X-TYPE's engines are also mounted horizonatally, so they are not taking up a terrible amount of longitudal space in the engine bay, thus the chances of them penetrating the passenger cabin is slim in comparison to longitudally oriented engines.  Again, however, the X-TYPE drops its engine when it has a severe frontal crash, so it never enters the passenger compartment no matter what engine size is used.  The argument that a 2.0 FWD X-TYPE would be safer than an AWD larger displacement version is null and void, because the engine does not enter the cabin at any time during any impact.You really should read the bottom chart of the EuroNCAP page for the X-TYPE:http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002It specifically states that the car is: ""Jaguar X-Type 2.0 LHD.  Only the FWD X-TYPE is built with the 2.0-litre engine, which again is the same engine block as the 2.5 and 3.0, but not drilled-out as much.  All other X-TYPEs are built in AWD configuration.  The AWD driveshaft of the AWD X-TYPEs aid in collisions v. the FWD version that is sold alongside them in Europe against 318 and C180.Mercedes-Benz decided to changed to a V6 from an I6 because they lowered the bonnet of the E-Class between those configurations and could not fit the I-6 under the lowered bonnet, as well as because it may have cost less to produce and it could be used in more vahicles as it had better packaging.  That is also the reason for the discontinuation of the E300 diesel, as the diesel engine could not fit under the lowered bonnet that was used when the V6 was introduced (that and because the E300 did not sell well here).  The E-Class should have been designed to drop its engine in a crash as well.  I've not heard of a modern car being designed so that its engine penetrates the passenger compartment in a collision."
147,"October  1, 2002 11:37PM",linard,"While the C-Class did gain an extra star because NCAP changed it's guidelines earlier this year on performance in crashes and safety features provided, the C class did earn it's full 5 stars as it's a very well designed car collision-wise, when I can find the article in which NCAP justified giving the C class an extra star b/c of it's overall performance, I'll paste the link.  As the pre 2003 E Class also includes this seatbelt light, your logic would conclude that it too, should receive 5 stars from it's previous 4 when it doesn't.  The fact that car engines are not designed to go into the passenger compartment is obvious, what isn't as obvious is while the X-Type is designed to, as you describe, drop it's engine and driveline components, they will always ""push"" into the compartment as evidenced by the Insurance Institute's listing of the crash details in which the X-Type exhibited moderate footwell intrusion, between 8 to 12 cm.  The best rated C Class, on the other hand, had intrusion measures of 2 to 3 cm.  Engineers are constantly trying to limit this phenomenon.  While I don't doubt the driveshaft aids in crash test scores, I wasn't trying to prove one way or another, I was speculating on a possible alternative.  And while I may be wrong on the engine block of the 2.0 being different from the 2.5 and the 3.0, I am certain that the E class' hood and front fender structures were lowered as a result of the new engine's newfound underhood space, and not due to the new engines being introduced b/c of the lowered hoodline.  This is evidenced by the 99 E320 having the V6 with the prefacelifted hoodline.  The discontinuation of the E300 in the U.Ss WAS caused by the low demand for that particular car AND b/c of the structural change.  However, that never meant that Mercedes dropped diesels from it's complete linup, in fact, Europe still has the option of a few remarkable diesel E class engines which Mercedes could have introduced here along with the redesigned 2000 E Class."

150,"October  2, 2002  7:33AM",wishnhigh1,"I have seen 3 Mercedes cars in accidents where the cars were totalled, two of which were rollover accidents. One of the rollover accidents was an S430, and it had a mild cabin protrusion, but nothing serious. The cabin was in perfect shape basically. The other was I believe a 600SEL. This one was extremely important because even though this car had pillarless windows, the roof of the car did not cave in at all, even though the car came to a rest upside down. The guy was still in the car at the time, and he was hanging upside down, with no visual bruises, and a few minor cuts from broken glass. The third accident was an E320 which was involved in a head on collision with a Camaro, who was racing another Camaro on a 2 lane road. I didnt see the drivers, but I saw the car as it was being towed away, and again, no cabin protrusion at all. The car was completely destroyed up to the point where the footwell started. Im generally dont praise late model Mercedes', but I will always say glamorous things about them when it comes to safety. In my opinion, they are a few steps above volvo. They also have some of the strongest roof structures short of a 3"" thick roll bar."
151,"October  2, 2002 10:38AM",sphinx99,"I'll say it up front, I don't think Edmunds does a consistent job on sedan reviews.  I understand the whole ""they're in BMW's payroll"" thing as well as the ""but we're not"" thing.  This month's letters to the editors & Edmunds' responses make good points on both sides.Unfortunately, Edmunds does a fabulous job of putting numbers to their words that later can be dug up and compared.  I'm specifically looking at the entry level luxury sedan comparos - 2001 where a TL-S edged out a 330i, then 2002 where a 330i wiped the floor with the competition.  The idea (and some will agree while others disagree) is that the scores tended to deliberately put BMW above the Acura.Is this happening?  Well, I decided to look at the numbers behind the comparisons to find out.  Given identical cars, whereas the two were eventually matched on performance in 2001, now there is a 20 point spread between them in 2002.  What, Acura got slower or BMW got faster?  Given identical front seat comfort in 2001, now for 2002 BMW front seat comfort is tops while Acura's is bottom.  Did the seats actually change, or did the editors of the 2002 review have smaller rumps?Not that only Acura gets the shaft either.  In 2001 BMW got a higher ""feature content"" rating than the TL-S.  In 2002, a 330i with MORE features than the 2001 model only tied the feature content rating than a TL-S with the same features.  This in spite of the fact that features the 330i lacked in 2001 (dual zone climate control, indash CD changer) were simply left off the Top 10 features list in 2002, leaving BMW as a vehicle that offers every Top 10 feature as either standard or optional.Basically, I like the prose of the articles and take away many good things from reading them.  When I look at the rankings, though, they seem to be statistically invalid; if, twelve months later, your opinions on identical seats can change that much, then how can you rank these cars based on 1% differences in the final rankings?In one of the comparos, it was stated that the margin for error was about 0.5%, and any two cars tallying numbers within .5% of each other would be considered tied.  I suggest increasing that buffer to 10% in order to account for the startling differences you find between two cars after just one year.Until then, I'm going to stop reading into the numbers and ranking, and concentrate on the prose and photographs.  We spend a great deal of effort arguing here about which sedan came in #1 and which one came in #2.  If you look at the numbers used to actually rank these vehicles against each other, they fluctuate so wildly from one set of editors to another (you'd think that using a set of editors would even out the fluctuation) so as to make the ranking of these vehicles practically worthless.Front seat comfort2001: Acura 83, BMW 832002: BMW 9.2, Acura 7.6Rear seat comfort2001: BMW 74 Acura 702002: Acura 9.2 BMW 5.8Conclusion: either BMW and Acura received total redesigns in 2002 unbeknownst to all of us, or the editor butt-o-meter does not produce repeatable results."

Many years ago in my first ever car, a 1988 Ford Taurus that I loved to death, I was rear-ended while sitting at a red light by an almost brand new Mercedes E-class.  He had some bumper damage and the front hood was a bit bent.  In contrast, my Taurus was destroyed--I was slammed into a Buick in front of me, and half the engine bay and almost all of the trunk were completely collapsed.  To the dearly departed Taurus's credit, there wasn't any cabin intrusion, and I only bruised my shins, but the car was totaled while the Benz probably picked up a thousand dollars worth of body work.  I'll never forget the Mercedes dude getting out of his car and bending over to keenly examine his slightly crunched bumper while I stared at my utterly destroyed car.On a more positive note, that was the last Ford I ever owned.  Whew!In conclusion: Mercedes sedans are notable not only for their defense, but for their offense as well.  If I were looking to take out Dodge Neon drivers, literally, I'd pick a S500 as my instrument of mayhem.

I hope I don't confuse you... what I'm trying to get at is that if stepping into say a E class isn't much more expensive than getting a C in terms of lease payments then would it be better to lease an E over the C... I don't know... I'm not the one who handles the money factor and negotiations... my father negotiates it to with in my budgette and then I just pay it no questions asked...lol... sounds dumb but oh well.. yeah my main cars that I'm looking at I'd half to say is below the 35K range... actually below the 33K sticker range cause then my father can negotiate the final prices... once again sorry for anyconfussion I'm just rateling off possibilities befor I make the final plunge into buying ... wait let me correct that ... leasing my own car... thank you all"

I have the 3.0 with the Tiptronic (automatic) transmission and live and work in the Cleveland area.  The 1.8T is a nice car, but the weight tends to make it sluggish.  It can be improved with aftermarket performance products (chip, exhaust, etc.), but would bring you up in price to the 3.0.The A4 3.0 has one of the nicest interiors around.  I also do mostly highway driving, and the interior combined with the performance handling makes this a pleasureable ride.  In winter, the Quattro system really shines.  I've been able to drive through some nasty snowstorms over the past 2 years, and I've always felt under control wherever I was going.Audi also has a 4 year / 50,000 mile service program that covers all service at no cost to you.  With that along with the 4 year / 50,000 mile warranty, all you'll spend is for gas and tires (if needed).  With the 2004 models now appearing on the lots, you can make a good deal on any remaining 2003s.Just some insight from a fellow Cleveland driver! =)  Good luck in your decision."

According to many sources (dealers and Infiniti customer service), most of the G35 require rotor replacement in addition to costly brake job. Infiniti knows about the problem and IS NOT paying for the rotors. Be prepared to buy yourself a new set of rotors for every brake job. And you will need this quite often, to the delight of your local dealer. Unfortunately, I was one of the early victims and did not expect that the car will be so bug ridden as it is.

A car with an MSRP of $40,000-$44,000 that actually sells for around $35,000 really is in this segment.  Lincoln (LS), Cadillac (CTS), Infiniti (M45) and some others heavily discount their cars.This would cover everything from Acura TSX, Nissan Maxima, Jag X-type 2.5, MB C230, and 300M (at the low end) and the 330i, 525i, Jag X-type 3.0 & C320 (at the high end) with a ton of cars in the middle.  Leaves cars like CTS6, LS6, and IS300 in the middle.Jag X-type a great example.  Easy to see MSRPs of the 3.0 over $40,000.  But Jag needs heavy subsidies and discounts to move.  And for 2004, Jag lowered the base price of the 3.0 by a couple thousand dollars and added a couple thousand dollars of ""free"" standard equipment.  The market spoke what this car was worth!"

211,"November  7, 2003  6:34PM",chrisboth,"The volvo is fast off the line - but IMO its a turbo vs NA thing which I believe all else equal you take the NA.  People who ahve driven the Volvo have said that it's very fast but not quite a sports sedan and doesn't feel as planted as a G or 3.To mod the G you can do a ton with the work the guys owning 350Z have done - since the underpinnings are the same as the G the G guys do what the Z guys innovate. Cold Air intake, Pulleys, light flywheel, grounding kit, intake plenum upgrade, cams are available, headers, catbacks and true duals are almost availble.  ECU upgrades to raise redline and improve mods where the ECU retard them by defaukt are available as well.PS a guy with exhaust intake and plenum upgrade with a ECU flash got a 14.1 in an auto sedan.  I think you could get to 13.9 with all the above.  NA babySome or many of these may add up to a couple grand but its fun for me over time to do most of these things.  Much more mods I think the m3 was good for and plenty more to come.  There are some serious enthusiast in G forums out there too.  Check em out"
212,"November  7, 2003  6:34PM",qbrozen,"ECU chip or reflash, exhaust, and intake.with the R you'd probably be up to around 340-350 hp with modest mods like that.  With the G35 its tougher to say, but maybe you could get it up to 275-285 (if a chip is available) without getting into the big money mods.Probably the biggest advantage of the R aside from AWD is the 4C suspension.  I really don't know why anyone would say it doesn't feel as planted when all reviews I've read state that you would NOT want to use the Advanced setting on the R unless you were on a track.  Sounds pretty planted to me.  But I haven't driven both cars, so take that for what its worth."

214,"November 12, 2003  3:47PM",helena143,"Hi. I am trying to decide between the G35 and a BMW 330i, and wud appreciate any ideas on what else I shud try. (I've tried both cars plus the IS300 and the RX-8). I was almost sold on the G35 until I read about its brake and cd players problems. Plus people are not pleased with Infiniti's service.I guess now I have no option, b/c the only comparable car to a G35 (BMW 330i w/ performance  package--a must. Otherwise it's too slow.) is too much $$$. After receiving excellent service from both Honda and Saab, I have no interest in getting crap from any service dept./dealer. I mean, Saab gives you a loaner even if you are getting an oil change! And they just finished replacing the entire 200 watt Harmon Kardon sound system on my 9-5 because ONE speaker was fried (which was me playing the music too loud, not a defect).  I definitely do not want to downgrade either in car quality (my 9-5 has been PERFECT) or service.However, I just did some research on Lexis and and Infiniti is rated very high by JD Power and Associates.For initial quality for the 2003 model year:1. Lexus2. Cadillac3. Infiniti8. BMW11. Honda14. Benz29. Mazda32. SaabFor dependability in 2003 (this rated vehicles of the 2000 model year after 3 years):1. Lexus2. Infiniti13. BMW12. Saab26. BenzFor 1998 models after 4 years:1. Lexus2. Infiniti10. BMW16. Benz19. SaabYet the bottom line seems to be that even tho Infiniti sells great cars, it has never developed the cachet of Lexus, much less BMW, etc. So it is desperate to sell cars. It is trying to rebuild its line (and Nissan) out of the slump brought on by the weak Yen and the success of Lexus. Of course, the problem is that it seems to be caring more about GETTING customers than keeping customers.Unless I get this car for below invoice, I won't take the chance on crappy product or service.Am I right?"

G-35 feels a little tight. both stick to the road and both seemed like they stop pretty well.  i did not feel tubro lag and s60 had pop when accelating. s60 is awd and weighs more(don't need awd in Fla) i think the s60 is a little faster and hold  a little better big 18"" wheels w P zero's.so my delema is which one do i get. what will hold up betterin the long term. s60r is awd which i guess is nice but really isn't needed in Fla.   one is more expensive but is damm good both in and out. one is cheaper looks better out then in.I think the g35 sedan wont hold value as well as the s60r because they will be produced  in greater quanity.any opinions would be appreciated."

220,"November 12, 2003  7:56PM",kdshapiro,If you want to acquire a car you have to go to the dealers and negotiate a deal.

221,"November 12, 2003  7:57PM",chrisboth,is just that history.  Residuals change all the time - get the facts before you decide based on a forum with old information.PS there is no negotiating the resiudual. it is what the bank tells you it is and no car dealer can change it
222,"November 12, 2003  8:08PM",kdshapiro,"There may be not negotiating the residual, but everything else is up for grabs including the cap cost. History is useful in that it gives a sense of the future. Reputation which is the companies number one asset is based on history."

Nothing other than current residuals and money costs matter right now for a new car purchase.  If history is an indication of future perfmance meaningful info is best found elsewhere such as the JD power results.  When residuals for 4 years out are best in class right now - why would you look at the past.  markets change - dont buy stocks this way
225,"November 12, 2003 10:26PM",kdshapiro,Most people buy blue chip stocks based on past history. I don't anyone who throws out a blue chip stock because they had a bad quarter. Usually look at the bigger picture. The same with lease residuals. The reason they are high for BMW is historically people are willing to pay a good dollar for BMW used vehicles.
226,"November 13, 2003  2:31PM",chrisboth,There is no fluffy big picture to a quantitatively defined lease residual.  The G Coupe gets best in class in Kiplinger's December Personal Finance Issue.  BMW get some nice comments as well but RIGHT NOW - the only thing that matters is what the math works out to be on a deal done today.  By virtue of today's lease residuals it costs less to buy G coupea as opposed to a 330ci ~ all else equal.You're not wrong to say that people have historically paid more for used Bimmers e it's true.  Now the reality is people will pay the most for a G coupe of any car out there.  Infiniti has had great cars for thier entire existence and now the market has bidded up one car int he lineup to reflect this.  BMW manages it's used car markets better than anyone and perhaps Nissan learned something.  History is nice but inadequate in most cases to accurately determine future trends.  People who look backwards only in portfolio management get fired.  In fact the real finds are in places where history has not been so kind.
227,"November 13, 2003  2:55PM",kdshapiro,"History is generally the only accepted principal in the financial markets. I'm not sure why you say it isn't. You are correct, lease residuals are enforce for a deal done in this specific minute. They can change in one day.

The only fundamental principal held by Chartered Financial Analysts, the highest designation for institutional money managers is having a basis for representing to a client that an invstment is suitable based on his needs.  This specifically has to based on forward looking fundamentals.  Reversion to the mean priciples suggests that what has done well in the past will not in the future and vice versa.History is about the last place you can justify an investment to a board a judge or the disciplinary body that can revoke the charter.

If it is now changed, it's changed, and it will change tomorrow again. But again history suggests that BMWs hold a higher residual than Infiniti. If Infiniti is pumping up the residual there will be a glut of used G35s available at bargain basement prices in a few years."
230,"November 13, 2003  4:12PM",chrisboth,66% for a coupe G after 3 years.  Read it one more time - december issue.  INfiniti can not set the residuals - the banks do.  Any time I say bank it's interchangable with financial institution.  Did your mom lend you the money?  Most institutions have similar numbers.  It will change tommorrow but probably not drastically.  The glut of ubiquitous 3's may drive that down - could be time to get a deal on a CPO 325!
231,"November 13, 2003  4:24PM",kdshapiro,chrisboth - the lending instutition sets the residuals. If the lending institution is wholly owned by the manufacturer they can set any residual they want.Will someone come forward and say they leased a G35 coupe with a 66% residual? What was the money factor? I'm not buying Kiplingers to see what the Infiniti residuals are.
232,"November 13, 2003  4:28PM",chrisboth,and if they set it too high they lose thier job or business.  predicting values 3-5 years out is an art and setting them this high has to be based on great market percpetion and actual values obtained in used car markets.  You get stuck with 66% of a car you have to be able to make money on it still.  Apparently institutions belive the G is the best coupe out here based on available and recently changed residuals.

Most folks will lease through the manufacturer's financing arm, and those residuals tend to be much better than those from leasing companies. If NMAC wants to to subsidise 66% residuals, that's ok, I am sure the money factor is adjusted for the higher residual anyway so it balances out."
237,"December  1, 2003  3:15AM",georgi1,"speedracer, you are right. In cases where companies offer higher residuals they would demand high interest (or money factors, if you'd prefer). In my experience the manufacturer's own financial company usually gives the higher residuals. However, beware that even though the monthly payments of high-res/high-mf & low-res/low-mf come out the same, if you decide to buy the vehicle at lease-end you would have to pay more for the higher residual. Personally, I've found the residual values on cars.com to better reflect what I see on used-car listings."

I used to road race motorcycles and if I only had a buck for every time I passed people in a corner only to watch them go flying past on the straight because they had more hp.

Why not spring for an extra $20,000 and get a 5 Series Sedan, or another $35,000 and get a 7 Series, or an Audi A8.

Mercedes for example makes a pretty fine car, and it's RWD, but most Benzes I have ever driven have not been the greatest handling cars (Please note that I have not driven every model Benz, just going by personal exp. so no need to flame me for above statement).For example, I had to drive my cousin's ML320 this weekend to get more food for my New Year's Party (his car was the last one in the driveway so was the only one available).Well the seats and the sound system in the ML320 were great.  The stiff steering, the sway in turns, and lack of feel on the road were awful.  I hit double curves at 70 MPH in that ML320 to test it out and came out thinking, hmmm, this was a bad idea.  The ML320 is a nice luxury car and has a much nicer interior than my Acura MDX, but in terms of handling, my FWD MDX kicks the RWD ML320."

Who is anybody to suggest to ME, how I should spend MY money and whether a particular car is worth it to ME and whether I will or won't derive any added benefit for paying more? This train of thought can be applied against any two vehicles.That being said, sometimes people will compare vehicles that are not really in the same target market and look at each vehicle on their own merits and then make a choice. Sometimes it doesn't matter if you get a two or seven seater and you can compare the two seater with the seven seater and each can be good in their own right. And a point in time either can satisify your requirements.saugatak - this is not a BMW thread and comparing these two vehicles has nothing to do with BMW. I am very familiar with both cars and each of these are fine vehicles in their own right. They offer different qualities that make them very attractive to potential purchasers.

Moreover, you get the prestige of a ""premium"" nameplate if you don't mind giving up heated leather seats, sunroof, CD changer, nav and other niceties that are included in a comparably priced TL. Also, if you are single or have a family with small kids only (rear seat space and trunk size), the BMW is ideal because its relatively smaller size enhances nimbleness. If you are concerned about snow (RWD), get the new AWD Beemer, which costs a couple of grand more. Having said all of the above, I would rather get the G35, which gives up little (if any) in performance and handling when compared with the Beemer, and use the $$ savings in filling up the gas tank that gives me miles of driving pleasure, plus the reliability of Infiniti to boot :-)"

I think the TL is the winner on those merits because I get more for my money with the TL. Paying an extra $10K for the prestige of the BMW name is OK if what you want is prestige. I am sure the guy in the 330i I blew off at the stoplight the other day is telling himself he has more ""prestige"".I am not sure every 330i owner is going to lose me on twisty road sections but I do know what 35hp in a straight line means. It means he better lose me in the twisty sections because he will give it back when the road straightens out.For the $10K I didn't spend on the BMW 330i do you suppose I could make even more performance improvements or make  many ""near luxury"" improvements to my TL?

I'm sure the guy you blew off at the light was laughing at you thinking: ""this guy has a new car and has to show it off, it's just not worth it"". Stop light races never impress me.

After all why would one buy a BMW for prestige, but not an Acura, the upscale division of Honda, for prestige? If one wants to argue about the amount of ""prestige"" a car has go ahead. I sincerely believe people buy a car because of the reputation of the manufacturer.One list thing about value. I don't need to be told a TL has more value than a 330, a Honda Accord has more value than a TL, a Mazda 6 four-banger has more value than an Accord, an Elantra has more value than a Mazda 6 four-banger. It's a given, the less you spend on a car the more value it has because it is fulfilling a basic need of getting you from point a to point b.

There are many IMO that will agree that they are a little more camry and minivan comparison worthy than 350Z and ZHP worthy.  50,000 acre test facililty wont get them better drivers or more enthused drivers.All the arguments about the price/value equation have the same old value is in the eye of the beholder ending.  The thing people forget with the G is that prestige is not paid for in the diplacement department and if a hypothetical buyer wants to get into the low 14 game with world class brakes and handling, he can get it for 28k.  Want a comparable 330i and how much is it?  10k more at least.  The whole value thing gets blown out of proportion and people need to relilze that BMW is excxlusive in that they will beat you to death with any options and everything is optional.  That add'l .5 litres is a big nut and takes a very reasonable platform that can be had for a pretty good priced and makes it the same price as a 5 series.

Those engines have been around for a while.  With all the work BMW has done on its VANOS V8s, surely they can migrate some of the technology down and free up some additional horsepower.I've heard that Honda has the ability to get 350 HP out of its basic SOHC VTEC v6 engine.  If true, that is amazing engineering and good news for Acura fans because we'll always be ahead of everyone else when it comes to the HP game.  Of course, Honda had better make a RWD platform soon so we can take advantage of that power!No matter what BMW fans say about ""Well I could beat u on the track"" or ""I don't have torque steer"" or ""if the roads were winding you'd eat my dust"", fact is raw horsepower is incredibly useful and most racing occurs not in tracks or windy roads, but on freeways or from stop light to stop light.Every time I'm merging into the right line of a busy highway with a short exit ramp and I see that 6-ton trailer coming in my rear view mirror, I'm glad for all the horses I have and am happy for more.I find that these discussions always start off comparing value, driving dynamics, prestige, etc. but at some point the ULTIMATE ARGUMENT gets unleashed:  ""Keep telling yourself how much better your car is while you eat my dust and look at my car's disappearing [non-permissible content removed].""It's great that TL drivers can make the ultimate argument."

I believe m3 handling can not be easily matched with a car in the same price range, except the corvette. g35 is also an excellent car and handles almost as good as the 330, i got the g because i didn't want another bmw 3 series. the car is exceptional when it comes to performance and the looks, many people talk to me about the car in parking lots and gas stations. meanwhile an m3 is as we know m3.i recently test drove the tl (actually borrowed it from the dealer - manager is my friend) and there was so much hype about the car, so i got it for a couple of hours (their demo) drove around the town. and i was quite impressed, it is a way better car than the old tl. but the hype in my opinion is not well worth.the sound system works excellent if you actually have a dvd audio disc (they had one that was sent from the factory i think) and it is just excellent quality. but when you put a regular cd it is nothing ordinary. the performance, it has excellent pick up, but the fwd downgrades the potential of this car. whatever others say, there is the torque steer, this car would have been excellent as an rwd, and i think as far as the pick up (in street start the g will beat the tl, well we know m3 performance is something else)the interior is good quality but does not match the refinement of the bmw 3 series or the audi or the mb, but better than the g. the interior space was less than the g along with the trunk space. i guess the g is a larger car overall and that makes a lot of difference, especially for me with a family and lots of people in the car at all times. i think interior space is similar to 3 series sedan. i am 6'3"" and with my seating position there was almost no space at the back of the driver's seat (a similarity to the 3 sedan)the handling of the car is not as refined as the 3 or the g. i realized this when i was entering a highway ramp at about 60-65 mph, and felt the need to hold the steering wheel with both hands very steady because the car almost got out of the road. it was a scary moment, and such wouldn't happen with a rwd 3 series or the g or the quattro audi. the handling is of course no issue in straight roads, but not everybody drives crazy like me in the backroads. i would prefer an audi quattro, 3 series or the g for backroads, mountain roads, but definitely not a tl. the car just didn't make me feel comfortable enough, kind of made me scared in a couple of situations.the looks are not so much in my style, it feels so dull and very accord like. it doesn't have a unique feeling of itself. i think they should have worked on the looks a little bit longer.overall the tl is an excellent value for an ordinary daily driver. it offers so much for so less, good interior, good performance, good safety features, and a low msrp.but for those who don't mind spending the extra cash i know that many will opt for other vehicles. acura tl in my opinion is the choice for first time near-luxo car buyers who do not have the ability of spending another 5k without worrying about their pockets.i am looking forward to the new vette and most likely i will be the first in line to add the car into my garage. and then maybe trade in the g for the 05 audi a6 quattro.meanwhile the argument of bmw is better than tl better than mb better than g better than this that can go on forever. but one need to know that everybody has a different budget, and different reason for buying a car. some people may not mind spending 40k, some people may only afford 34k some can not even afford that and some go out and buy a ferrari for 200k. instead of comparing i think it is best to drive the car and enjoy the purchase. i honestly did not see a ferrari owner and a lamborghini owner fighting and arguing about their cars and try to prove one is better than the other.because they just don't care much, they enjoy th"

292,"January  4, 2004  4:03PM",kdshapiro,"A new 2004 Accord drove up into my driveway last night. It had all the goodies, sat/nav etc. Out the door price was a little over $28K. The TL with nav is about $35K. After tooling around in this vehicle I realized the only reason that people would go for the TL at $7K more or the TSX which is a four-banger is the ""so-called"" prestige factor of the Acura brand.You could never derive the additional $7K in driving benefit from a TL. And it beats the TSX hands down. For the price/feature content this car beats 'em all. Of course it is FWD and if you are happy with that you will probably be getting a reliable Honda, with a powerful engine and a smooth drive train.After thinking about it I can see why there  might be some people who don't want to spring for the extra money for a 330i to get it identically optioned. It's because the perception is they are actually getting less for their money. I can now see that, as I believe when you buy a TL with nav etc your money has hit the point of diminishing returns against a similiarly equipped Accord. You are actually paying more money to get less car.While I really wanted an X3 due to the NE climate, I might have to reverse myself and say the Honda with nav and such offers the best bang for the buck (even though it has torque steer and fwd) and save myself $12 grand, which I can use towards my kids college education or home improvements."
293,"January  4, 2004  4:17PM",riez,"For those who love numbers, compare performance and price numbers for cars like the Neon SRT-4 and Sentra SE-R Spec V.  Ensure you add the available performance options like LSD to SRT-4 and the Brembo brake package to the Spec V.  Then compare these cars, which cost around $20,000, to the 330i or TL.  That SRT-4 will run (run over?) the TL or 330i and save you a small fortune in the process.  But is it a legitimate comparison?Price to performance is not the only way to go nor even always a relevant comparison."
294,"January  4, 2004  5:57PM",pg48477,"kd, People buy TL over Accord, for the same reason you bought your 330 over 325.riez, Those two cars you mentioned have no luxury factor, if I would settle for something like that I would get WRX Sti or Evolution 8.zumbalak, looks like you have a lot of experience driving RWD, that is why you had few scary moments driving FWD TL, you dont drive FWD the way you drive RWD. I for example had a few scary moments driving G35 coup 6mt, bacouse I'm not use to pushing RWD to the limit, I even span once."
295,"January  4, 2004  6:42PM",riez,"pg48477...  You prove my point.  If luxury is the primary criteria, then why are people obsessing about performance numbers?  And if price/value is the primary criteria, then there are a lot ""better"" less expensive cars out there.And that leaves us the dilemma of this board:  What does it mean to be a ""near luxury performance sedan""?  Are luxury and performance equal?  Or is performance more important than luxury?  Or vice versa?  I firmly believe in performance taking precedence, but not at the expense of luxury.  And other factors like reliability, warranty, customer service, operating costs, etc. cannot be left out of the equation.  But if you don't define terms and weight what is important, all you do is debate apples and oranges?  Or Granny Smith apples vs. Red Delicious apples?"

299,"January  4, 2004  7:18PM",saugatak,"Think that's a topic for another board, but I don't think anyone can argue that v6 Camry or v6 Accord (will refer to them as CamCord from now on) give you best bang for buck.  Yes, you can get a lower brand car but the CamCord is renowned for its reliability and low gas mileage and due to its reliability has a low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).With respect to the price differential between a nav-Accord and a nav-TL, I agree the nav-Accord wins in the value equation, but from what I've read (somebody with more exp. with both systems please help me out) the Acura's nav system is a lot better.  I have not bought any nav systems in my cars to this point (I find a $20 map/atlas that I can carry from car to car is a pretty unbeatable value) so I don't know this for sure, but my understanding is that the nav system on the TL allows you to say ""Phone Home"" and then the car will dial the number for you, whereas this is not possible on the nav-equipped Accord.Now this may seem silly to you but I kind of dig this feature a lot for 3 reasons:1)  I never use a cell phone when driving (unless I'm stuck in traffic and need to tell someone I'll be late) because it's dangerous so to be able to make voice-activated calls is incredibly useful.  Time is money and if I can conduct some business while on the phone and save some time, the Nav system on the TL could pay for itself.  Also, if you must talk on the phone, this is a much safer way to do it and could save your life, which is definitely worth something.2)  One of my favorite shows as a kid was Knight Rider (in spite of David Hasselhoff) because the talking corvette with the roving Cylon eye was just so cool.  There is a fun factor in talking to your car and getting a response back that is hard to quantify.3)  If I buy the TL, it'll be the 6MT so with a stick in right hand  and wheel in left hand, voice-activated calling is really more than a luxury, it's almost a necessity.The point is although objectively the nav-Accord beats the nav-TL, I think there are some good reasons to spring the extra $ for the superior Acura nav./voice system.With respect to the current generation v6 Accords, I found that Honda took all the driving fun out of the current gen. Accord.  To me, they have the driving feel of a Camry and frankly, the Camry is a better Camry than the Accord is.  When you compare prices on the non-nav Accord v6 and non-nav TL, I think the price difference is only $3,700 (based on my market research that I could get the Accord for $600 over invoice and the TL for $2k under MSRP based on what's been posted on the prices paid boards).I think the extra $3,700 is money well spent to upgrade from non-nav Accord to non-nav TL.  Also, I really want a 6MT and unfortunately the Accord sedan does not come in 6MT and v6.  I'd have to get the Accord 6MT v6 Coupe.And my wife's response when I suggested that we save some cash on my car by me getting the Accord 6MT Coupe was:  ""I always sit in the front and you are responsible for putting son in the back seat and pulling him out of the back seat.""Well I like to save money like the next guy, but destroying my back is not the way I'm gonna do it so it's the TL for me."
300,"January  4, 2004  7:31PM",saugatak,"I don't normally defend kdshapiro, but I really think that his basic point that ""value is in the eyes of the beholder"" is correct.It's kind of hard to compare the TL to any BMW b/c pricewise it's closer to the 3-series but sizewise it's comparable to the 5-series.If you are someone who places a high premium on being able to hit 270 degree exit ramps at 65 and really enjoys driving your car beyond 8/10ths on twisty roads, there really is just one sedan out there for you and that's BMW.  Also as someone who drove a 3-series in his 20s, I have to say that I had a much, much easier time picking up hot girls with that car than any other car I've had before or since.I think if you exclude the 2 factors I mentioned above, the TL whomps the BMW 3-series, but getting hot girls with minimal efforts is, as they say in the MasterCard commercial, PRICELESS.OK, I think most of the people on these boards are men and hopefully I haven't offended any women."

However, even this objectively quantifiable factor may be viewed subjectively, depending on the viewer's wealth, dispositions and priorities in life, spending habits ... and not to mention the proverbial ""ego"" or ""status"" factor.

But you can say the exact same thing, only even worse, for the Accord V6 vs TL.  They are siblings from the same company.  Thus, if you can't say it for the Accord, you can't logically say it for the 330i."
306,"January  4, 2004  8:51PM",riez,"We always end up apples to oranges because we can't agree on even the most basic of things.  For example, what is the relevant price spread?  Is it under $40K?  Over $25K but less than $45K?  For me, I think the ""meat"" of this market segment is in the $27,500-$32,500 range but this segment includes outliers costing at least $25K but no more than $35K.  But notice how subjective everything is?  Thus, for me, the 330i comparison should be with a stripped one, not a loaded one.  The loaded ones and the 330i with Perf. Pkg push $40K.  To me, $40K is squarely in the realm of luxury performance sedan.  There ain't no ""near"" at $40K.  That is why I went with a loaded IS300 manual for approx. $32,500 MSRP when a similar 330i was nearly $40K.  For $32,500 MSRP I could get a decently equipped (but just) 325i but not a 330i.  (And I don't want to bring in ED issue.)Wish we had three boards.  One for FWD, one for AWD, and one for RWD.  For me, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" FWDer.  That is an oxymoron.  And I wouldn't want the weight penalty that AWD brings.And, staying purely, subjective, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" car with an automatic transmission.

Your statement is incorrect to the extent it is not the size or weight of a 3 series. Yes you can make a go-cart perform better than a three series, but make the Mini-cooper 3300 lbs, give it four ""real"" seats and it wouldn't outhandle a go-cart. With 0 to 60 acceleration of 8 seconds, I'm not sure how it outperforms the 330i. But in it's weight class, it just does fine. The SRT4 also outperformns the 330i, but add an additional 400lbs or so and it wouldn't accelerate it's way out of a paper-bag. Add 500lbs and 2 more seats to an S2000 to make it's weight equivalent to a 3 series and it wouldn't perform either. Yes it's very easy to make a car that out accelerates any other car, just cut down on seats, and mitigate with weight and you've got a winner. But we are not talking about these types of cars.To some paying the additional $$$ for a 330i, a vehicle with the best drivetrain in the business, smoothest in-line six, vaunted handling is worth it.

325,"January  5, 2004  7:27PM",fedlawman,"Your assertion that a car must be RWD to be a ""true"" sports car is preposterous.Compare the IS300 to the Mazda 6s. Both cars are within a hair of each other in HP, TQ, 0-60 and 1/4 mile acceleration, skidpad grip, slalom speed, and braking distances.Even the weight distribution is close (54/46 vs. 59/41). Yes, dynamically FWD and RWD perform differently. From a standing start, the IS300 has an advantage over the Mazda 6 because it has better traction to the drive wheels. On a racetrack however, that advantage is gone, as it simply requires a different driving technique (line) to make a FWD go fast vs. a RWD. Basically, going around a road course quickly involves three elements - power-to-weight ratio, braking performance, and traction. In corners, traction is key because the more you have, the more power you can put down on the pavement. The factor that most affects traction is weight transfer, which is why smoothness is so important for fast lap times. Compared to a FWD car, in a RWD car, turn-in happens sooner because during braking (entry), weight shifts away from the drive wheels, and the resulting loss of traction can cause oversteer. Since turn-in is earlier, the apex also comes sooner, causing the line to straighten and allow the driver to begin accelerating. This technique obviously won't work well in a FWD car because the ""wrong wheels"" need the traction to exit the corner. Therefore, weight transfer through a corner must be managed differently for a FWD car.If you're piloting a FWD car into a corner, you adjust your line by braking and turning-in later. This adjusts the line by moving the apex out farther. With a later apex, the FWD'er straightens the line through the turn and can accelerate harder, sooner.It may not seem as natural to you, but it is no less effective at producing fast lap times.As far as torque steer is concerned - no it's not fun, but modern high performance FWD cars (like the Mazda 6 or Acura TL) have it managed very well, so if it's present at all, it's more of a distraction than a performance handcap.Of course, all of this talk is moot on the street. At 8/10ths, it rarely comes into play.For the most fun and biggest performance gains, attend a driving school and put good rubber on your wheels."

The comment was the accord has about the right of power...anyone else see this so as to help me remember the show?  The very thing Rear Drivers enjoy is the differnt stlye of driving that reat powered cars afford us.....that little correction to puposefully oversteer to put the car in line as the weight transfers to the drive wheels is the majic that people wont give up.  As a 10 year front driver...they are fun in turns - really...but not as fun and not as easy to apex as RWD. The chatter from torque steer is one of the most unsettling things you can deal with - not for fear of losing control as FWD are easier to keep in contol...just feels cruddy when your driving and it feels like an earthquake is shaking the wheel...and combined with LSD and traction...its a little bit worse than my integra was."

328,"January  5, 2004 10:52PM",fedlawman,"I haven't driven the TL so I cannot comment on its torque steer. I do admit that 270 HP is a lot to send to the front wheels...That said, while I don't believe FWD takes away from the fun to be had driving the TL, I do suspect that its 3700# curb weight makes it more of a Grand Tourer than a canyon carver. I would take a TSX over the TL any day...and in fact, I did!"
329,"January  6, 2004 12:23AM",chrisboth,"ACura rocks in many ways - the TL is a sweet ride but it is not a sports sedan at 85-95% of the envelope - while it may perform in curves nearly as well - hell even as well - better? possibly with ASPEC, it won't feel as competently done.  That late turn in the FWD offers is kinda neat and I enjoyed it in the acura's I've owned and driven but the rumbling torque steer  over bumps or uneven pavement is a very unimpressive offering for you and your passengers in a heavy car even.  The tsx may be the best value for that market segment ever.  It's very much like the TL in terms of appearance and stance...TSX owners must love it!  And not vice versa"
330,"January  6, 2004 12:45AM",riez,"fedlawman... Please review the earlier recent posts.  As I said, I am NOT talking smooth test track performance.  Heck, using that criteria a FWDer with a live rear axle can be quite the performer.  I'm talking on the real roads I drive every day.  On the twisties.  On the curves.  On the bumps.  (You really appreciate IRS when you are taking a nice sweeper fast and you hit a bump.  When you lack IRS the entire rear bounces up in the air and you say a silent prayer.  Not unlike torque steer!) Today I had fun ""playing"" with my business FWD Sonata (V6, 5-speed manual with defeatable traction control) in the snow and ice.  She tugs and pulls like crazy every time she loses traction.  All that weight over the front wheels and those drive wheels trying to steer at the same time they fight for traction.  You fight to steer her.  Just take a corner as you lose some front wheel traction.  Pulls left then right.  Laws of physics.  That is true for every FWDer I've ever driven hard.  (And, yeah, I had fun driving '01 TL Type S but she torque steered.  Same for the I35 Sport I drove.)  Only way to go is to ensure the drive wheels are not the steering wheels!  Don't forget that 5% of 3,000 pounds is 150 pounds.  FWDer is like having your pre-teen sitting on your hood all the time."
331,"January  6, 2004 12:47AM",saugatak,"FWD vs RWD has been debated to death.  My personal take is that the difference is overrated.MB makes RWD vehicles but how well do they handle?  Every MB I've ever driven has been a nice car but handling wasn not really its strongest characteristic.Lexus makes both FWD and RWD cars, but aside from Riez's favorite IS300 (LOL, he has 2 of 'em), I would really have to focus very hard to tell the difference in the drivetrain.  A soft plushy ride completely divorced from any feel for the road sucks whether the drivetrain is a FWD or RWD.If you really want to make a performance car, you not only have to have the RWD but you need to do all the other things it takes to get the weight balance as close to 50-50.  Not sure what the exact weight balance on the IS300 is Riez, but it doesn't sound anywhere close to 50-50, so on that basis Infiniti G35 and BMW are going to be a lot better than IS300.Also, I think if you are used to a RWD and then go to a FWD, the difference is really noticeable so you tend to overemphasize it.  The opposite is also true.For example, I'm now used to my MDX and when I had to drive an ML320, it took me a while to get used to the turns.  Once I got used to it in 5 mins. it was fine.I find that as long as I have some feel for the road, I can get used to just about any car and drive with my normal skill level, and after a while don't notice it unless I try to go above 7/10ths.Living in the NE, I prefer FWD b/c I can slap on all seasons and not worry about snow tires.  Yes, you can get a RWD/AWD sedan, but those are a lot heavier, so their performance is compromised and they eat up a lot more gas.When I move to CA, where bad weather isn't as much of a problem, I'd give a lot more consideration to RWD, but I'm not going to let the drivetrain alone influence my decision as to which car I want."

Both offer soft, plush rides with little road feel.  ES330 has too little power to have any torque steer.  Does the drivetrain really make a difference?  I mean, how much do I care that a bad handling RWD car might handle slightly better than a bad handling FWD car?  I would never push a bad handlng RWD car to the limits anyway so what have I gained with the RWD drivetrain?riez, it's great you love your IS300 so much that you got 2 of 'em LOL, but there's a lot more to handling than drivetrain and you know it."

I was amazed that you could actually talk to the navigation system.Finally, I was amazed at how plush the honda was and how spartan the BMW was.  the BMW was almost embarassingly uncomfortable on the inside.All this being said, can anyone really justify goping with the BMW here?  Also, can anyone justify spending $4k more for the Acura TL.Maybe go for the BMW because of 1) all wheel drive and 2) prestige of driving a BMW?Please let me know, Thank you."

We are talking about stock cars without any additions from after market, hey Saab does not have 3.0 V6 like IS does.riez and kd, I wonder how far you two push you RWD cars. I have a TL and I really in to cars so I have driven quiet a few RWD and FWD cars. With that said do you really know your cars limits, I bet you don't, because if you do you must of crash it a few times (or be really close to it) to understand were exactly the limit is. In order to compare RWD and FWD you really have to spend alot of time driving each one and really push it to the limit, and that would only be possible only on the race trace or on the empty road at night. I don't think any of you two had this kind of experience and for this meter so as anybody else on this side including myself. So if you think that RWD is better than FWD that is your opinion, not a fact, and it varies from car to car.

Now could a professional push it harder, absolutely.Honda Accord V6 to a BMW 325 for $28,000. To me it's no contest, the Honda is very nice at that price. I never go for loaded cars, but there is a certain level of options that I want. A $28,000 BMW does  not have it. Having just driven a loaded Honda Accord, I can say it drives very nicely. Could I see myself driving it? Absolutely? Does it handle anywhere close to my 330i. Not a chance.

If you're idea of handling is to plow threw snow with all-seasons a FWD will outdo a RWD. But I can feel the difference between a great FWD and a great RWD. It is no contest. Does it make a difference going to work on traffic clogged streets. No. But that is not what this conversation is about, or else we would all be driving Hyundais (sorry shenkar that's the last of it). A great RWD will be able to outperform in the aggregate a great FWD, because of the balance and power delivery. As I said it doesn't make a difference in traffic cloggeds streets, but that is not what this conversation is about. What drive-train one chooses is a personal preference. They each have their advantages and limitations.But let's not confuse the ability of the car with the ability of the driver or amount of traffic on the road."

NASCAR uses live axles and carburetors (I can't hardly spell this archaic word).  Much more powerful F1 cars have various restrictions on engine size, etc.  F1 cars in early 1980s put out 1,200 HP.

There is no racing series I know, reputable and offical, that allows an absolute free-for-all for cars--any size, weight, engine size, any engine configuration, turbos, superchargers, nitrous oxide or other performance enhancers, AWD, etc.  Would be fascinating."

368,"January  7, 2004 12:29AM",blueguydotcom,"If you live in the north east, should you get awd 330 over a rwd 330. If soemone was given a choice what is the downside to choosing the awd if there is any. (obviously the downside to the rwd is handling in less then clear dry conditions) I'm fairly certain I would have passed on a 330i with AWD.  I don't like the understeer then neutral then oversteer drive feel of an AWD car.  My friend's WRX is a fun, highly modded car but the AWD system makes me VERY happy to get back into my RWD 330i.  Additionally, I'm not impressed by the higher maintenance costs, lower mileage and added weight.  BTW, I live in southern california, so AWD is really only for the snowboarders and the...rock climbers?  Not many of us face weather that needs AWD."
369,"January  7, 2004 12:47AM",saugatak,"I agree that a well built well designed performance car with RWD is the best handling sedan out there ON NON-SNOWY ROADS.In 2002 in the Northeast when there were a lot of snowstorms, RWD cars without snowtires got stuck on the road.  If my ride were a BMW 330 (not an all wheel drive), I'd have to buy at least 2 snow tires for the rear wheels and hang on to them.  Then I'd have to go to the mechanic to get them installed before the snowstorm hits.Oh no, everyone else is on line doing the same thing and the mechanic can't get to me, too bad.  Now I'm stuck on snow roads with regular tires in a RWD car.  Oh damn, now I just got stuck and have to walk home in 2 foot snow while getting snowsprayed by all the FWD cars going through no problem.  Or better yet, I just spun out but before I crashed I was thinking ""Well this is a small price to pay for having a RWD performance car.""In NY, I drive a FWD car out of choice b/c I have gotten stuck in snow in RWD cars, but I have never gotten stuck in a FWD car.  And yes, I did have an AWD Audi but the extra weight on the car made the car really slow and a gas hog.And what happens if I trade in the car and it uses different size tires?  Now I have to get new snow tires and try to sell the old ones.  Good luck getting value for those old snow tires.In sum, RWD in a good performance car gives best performance but that don't mean much in snow.AWD gives best snow performance but on dry roads it's slower, the heavier weight of the car affects its turning ability and when you have to do a lot of turning the software on the AWD system gets confused so the car acts schizophrenic.FWD doesn't give as good a performance in snow as AWD, but it's usually good enough and its performance on dry roads is second to RWD but better than AWD, and it usually has the best gas mileage.I think that manufacturers will continue to make FWD, RWD and AWD cars to suit different tastes and climates.  Since the CamCord are the best selling cars and they're FWD (plus they show no signs of giving up the sales crown), I disagree with your contention that FWD cars are a thing of the past."

In today's data, IS300 retains best rating and 330i has fallen to only average reliability.Interesting that of the 15 cars in their ""upscale sedan category"", the FWDers finished 1st, 4th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 14th, and 15th.  The RWDers finished 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 12th.  The AWDers finished 7th and 13th.  Say the RWDers win this one."
371,"January  7, 2004  1:50AM",fedlawman,"The TL's biggest handicap vs. the IS300 and 330i isn't its drivetrain, it's curb weight."
372,"January  7, 2004  1:56AM",riez,"FWD is inherently front heavy.  And it asks the drive wheels to steer.  FWD cannot overcome the laws of physics.  Which is one reason there is no FWD supercar.A FWDer and RWDer of the same total weight will NOT have that weight evenly distributed.  That weight distribution penalty causes an inherent disadvantage.  And since the best tires can go on any vehicle, the FWDer cannot overcome its limitations by using better rubber."
373,"January  7, 2004  2:08AM",raher,Were all of the vehicles equipped the same ( as in all had manual trans? ) The car and Driver test of the TL showed much better 0-60 times ( 5.7 as I recall and I know it was the manual trans  )..much worse braking ( 180 some feet I think ). A nice set of comparison numbers you put together however
374,"January  7, 2004  3:34AM",pg48477,"CR road test, all vehicles have AT.riez, I think we all agree that tires men a lot when it comes to handling.Here is some stats. for you:Bridgestone Turanza EL42 P235/45R17 93W : handling rating - 5.80, dry traction - 6.30, wet traction - 5.1Goodyear Eagle GS-D 215/45ZR17 87W tires: handling rating - 8.80, dry traction - 9.20, wet traction - 9.10ContiTouringContact 205/50R17 93V tires: handling rating - 8.30, dry traction - 8.70, wet traction - 7.7The number are based on 10 point system and taken from tire rack. As you can see TL has the worse tires by far. This is why TL scored marginally lover in handling and accelerations tests, plus as somebody mentioned TL is also heavier.With that said , if you put the same tires on all three vehicles you will get almost identical numbers in handling."
375,"January  7, 2004  3:36AM",riez,"raher...  I wrote, ""For those who love numbers, with each being tested with an automatic transmission...""  They were all tested by CR with 5-speed automatic transmissions.Do keep in mind that you have to pay careful attention to the test methodology.  If you study the fine print of R&T, MT, and C&D, you'll see how they do theirs.  Tells how they achieve maximum 0-60 mph times (e.g., high RPM drop clutch) and whether they publish actual results (what they did that day on that track at that altitude at that temperature) or adjusted results (mathematically altering the data for temperature, etc.).  Thinking C&D and MT publish adjusted results and R&T publishes actual results.  Also thinking R&T discusses how results within a certain range are essentially statistically not different.  (I prefer their methodology, even though C&D is much more enjoyable to read.)"
376,"January  7, 2004  3:39AM",riez,"pg48477...  Not familiar with these numbers.  What is their methodolgy?  Are these ""objective"" numbers (e.g., each tire is tested on the same car with the same driver on the same track at the same temperature, etc.) or ""subjective"" guestimates?  Do you happen to know the DOT grades (temperature, wear, and traction) for each of these tires?The ContiTouringContacts are NOT a performance tire.  Continental ContiSportContacts and ContiSportContact 2s are Continentals highest performing tires.  My wife's '00 323ia had the Tourings; I put a set of SportContact 2s on my '98 540i6.  World of difference.CR's 330i would have handled and braked much better if it had had the optional Sport Pkg, which it did not.  The Sport Pkg provides improved suspension setting and better tires (e.g., a tire like the SportContact)."
377,"January  7, 2004  3:45AM",riez,"You'll notice that the TL rode on the widest tires (235 mm).  Much, much wider than the 330i's (a mere 205 mm) and much wider than the IS300's (just 215 mm).  Tire width means bigger contact patch.  All other things equal, a wider tire should improve braking and (most) handling-related numbers.In the realm of tires, a 30 mm width difference is like the grand canyon.  Thinking 25 mm is approx. 1 inch."

There ARE no buts about that. The TL still cannot match the BMWs overall performance, and as C&D notes, the braking from 70 is way behind the 330i. So while I don't begrudge the TL top spot in CR, it doesn't mean it's really best in class, just best in VALUE.The 3 series redesign is now a few years old, to have every other magazine, still note it's the benchmark except for one, says mountains about the car. Do you think the Acura will remain on the top for 4 years in a row?And while nobody needs an BMW, Acura or even an expensive Honda or Mazda, they also note the Accord is almost as good as the TL for $7K less.

Weighing the capabilities and content against the cost equates the value.So I say again, the TL is a better VALUE because it is closer in CAPABILITY to the 330 than the Accord is to the TL.  In other words, the $7K price hike to get the TL over the Accord nets you MUCH greater results than the $7K price hike (although its even more than that!) to get the 330 over the TL.

Case in point, KD may want to assign 50 points to performance (because he is a performance fanatic) and only 5 points to value (because he is loaded and doesn't mind spending more money). If you tally the score based on weighted answers, your conclusion could very well be flawed.Unless you all agree to the amount of weight to be given to each question (or factor), and I can assure you that you will never agree, the entire exercise is futile :-)"

432,"January  8, 2004  1:16PM",riez,"cybersol...  CR ranks the G35 12th out of the 15 cars in their upscale sedan category.  CR's full test of the G35 sedan was in the July 2003 issue.  In that test it came out fourth behind the Lincoln LS6, Cadillac CTS, and Nissan Maxima 3.5 SE, but ahead of the Saab 9-3 Vector.  They tested a G35 automatic.  Test data:Dry braking, 60-0 mph:  133 ftAvoidance maneuver:  54.0 mph0-60 mph:  6.8 secs1/4 mile:  15.4 secs45-65 mph:  4.3 secsFuel economy:  20 mpgTires:  Bridgestone Turanza EL42, P215/55R17 93V.  So, again, pretty narrow tires compared to TL's 235s.Predicted reliability:  2nd best rating."
433,"January  8, 2004  1:33PM",chrisboth,Notice the above time is the worst ever published for the sedan.  I'd take my grounding wired G35 against a TL and feel pretty confident I'd tie or better 50% of the time.  6.8 is bad.  The 5AT records 6.2 and the 6MT is approx 5.5-5.9.  45-65 tells all about the power of the these motors.  Anyone care to put up those numbers comparing TL/3/IS...
434,"January  8, 2004  1:47PM",riez,"Remember to take into account equipment on the tested car.  The BMW 330i was NOT tested with its most valuable Sport Package.  Don't believe the G35 had its either.  So they ran on terrible tires.Also, you have to take into account CR's methodology.  Compare that to methodology of car magazines.  Auto press usually uses whatever most aggressive method at launch.And remember that CR does NOT get its cars from the manufacturers.  It buys real cars off real dealers' lots.  Is easy for manufacturers to give car magazines ringers!"
435,"January  8, 2004  2:14PM",kdshapiro,"The Ultimate Argument does not hold water. Performance figures do not indicate a 330i will be seeing the taillights of any car in this category. The cars the 330i will see the taillights of so will the TL and G35. Since I have no plans on racing you on the street and potentially hurting myself or other drivers, I will have to leave it to people who measure such things.Even with CRs testing methodolody, G35 came in behind 330i. It's not about the 330i being faster, it's about the 330i being the more expensive, holding it's own against cars having bigger engines, with a 35 hp/torque advantage. And while the 330i may lose the quarter mile to a G35, it loses by .1 second to a car with a .5 liter bigger engine.riez - I believe is correct, that car mags use a do-or-die method to get the absolute fastest time. You wouldn't necessarily want to do that to your car. CR probably uses a more conservative approach, where drivetrain parts do not get strewn all over the tarmac.Not knocking either car, you can't dismiss the performance/handling aspect of the 3-series, while extolling the value aspect of either car.chrisboth - show me one review where the G35 sedan 6MT has a 5.5 time to 60."
436,"January  8, 2004  4:28PM",qbrozen,"The Legacy GT is another one I'm looking forward to.  But I'd be surprised if it bests the others.  It will probably be faster in a straight line with a tall clutch dump, but on a track they will be much closer.  Unless Subaru finally puts a real sporting suspension on a non-STi product, its not going to be very tossable."
437,"January  8, 2004  4:35PM",chrisboth,"""You G35, TL & IS300 worshipers are gonna be upset when the new 2005 Legacy finally hits the shores. Performance and handling will leave those behind. I say it here now so you won't be disappointed when the mags say it later. ""This car may be geared to get to 60 in less than 6 but lets see the real numbers when tested and see the rest of the story.  I expect it to be a solid car but I doubt 3/G lovers are weeping just yet.  250 HP spread to 4 wheels is about what an a-4 is...fun but no M5."
438,"January  8, 2004  4:36PM",buddhabman,"If you review the few mag articles that relate specifically to the GT, they mention how balanced the handling is.  The rub has always been the lack of power, and the interior refinement."

440,"January  8, 2004  4:42PM",buddhabman,"For mountain highway travel, canyon carving and all purpose driving the Legacy has always been a sleeper.

441,"January  8, 2004  5:19PM",chrisboth,Thats more like it..400 hp is the benchmark - I hope everyone has an offering with that in mind.  It will come down to pricing if these makers can really produce what they say they are..pretty comparable cars...the car that we Infiniti enthusiast long await is called Skyline-GTR and it will have near 500 hp for a speculated 55k or so and look like a cross between a G and a bugatti and a viper.  The 2006-2008 car shopping seasons should be interesting for us.Lets not forget that these are more sports cars than sports sedans.  Hopefully I'll be in the minivan by then toting kids around.

442,"January  8, 2004  6:04PM",speedracer3,"Sorry riez, but the IS300 is the only Lexus that actually looks and feels like a regular Toyota. After sitting in the interior for five minutes one thing came to mind ""Corolla"". I am sure it handles great and all that, but the interior IMO the interior is major turnoff. Ok, maybe I am spoiled, but after driving an Audi for almost a year I've become what you call a ""dash-stroker""."

Which by the way is not bad considering the passat interior is one of the most refined even out of its own class.  While the interior was nicer in the audi it made me bored.

But then again, I'm NOT looking for fake wood trim, ""warm"" brown interiors, etc.  I want only black interior and prefer aluminum/chrome trim piece interiors.The IS300 has beautiful ""drilled"" pedals and the interesting chronograph instrument cluster.  The IS300 has one more legitimate gauge than either the 323ia or 540i6.  The IS300 is a boy racer interior.  Serious interior for serious fun!  What more could you want out of an interior?  Luxury?  Not me!(My wife was always mad about the 323ia.  It lacked the chrome doorsill plate like the 540i6.  The 3 Series is just decent interior wise.)"
445,"January  8, 2004  8:15PM",speedracer3,"BMW interiors certainly have the material quality you would expect out of a luxury car, but the styling itself is austere. IMO, a bit boring. The G35 is fine ergonomically, but the quality of some of the plastics is poor for a luxury car. The IS300 has a boy racer look that not everybody cares for, some of the materials are Toyota not Lexus quality and I don't care for that chronograph speedo and such. Audi interiors are not always ergonomically sound (putting a cupholder over the stereo comes to mind), but the quality of plastics is incredible, also there is so much attention to detail and style that it is a pleasure to sit inside day in and day out."

462,"January  9, 2004 12:31AM",riez,"chrisboth & kahunah...  What percentage of long-term ownership costs do you think are related to fuel?  Not much.  Depreciation is the biggest hit.  Don't forget about insurance.  TTL.  Annual registration.  Maintenance, including tires.I paid about $30,000 for the car.  I'm getting about 25-26 mpg.  If I drive 100,000 miles over 6 years that will take about 3,922 gallons of fuel (at 25.5 avg.mpg).  In my town right now premium (Amoco/BP Ultimate, the only fuel I use) costs about $1.63 per gallon.  That would be a mere $6,393 in total fuel costs.  My car insurance over the same time would be about $7,200.  The intitial tax on the car was around $1,500.  In the first five years of ownership, it will cost me about $1,950 just to register the car ($325 per year).  Four sets of tires will cost me at least $1,600 (at just $100 per tire).  And what will depreciation be over this 100k/6 years?  Probably about $20-24,000.  So that $6,393 in fuel isn't a big consideration.  Say I got 30 mpg.  That would be 3,333 gallons for $5,433.  Or a mere $960.  $160 per year. Or just $.0096 per mile driven.  Is this a big deal?  Not even a penny a mile.[Hope I did my maths right.]I'm getting nearly 26 mpg.  That is SUV-like???  Not hardly!

I seldom even check the mileage any more. One of the beauties of not having a trip computer is you don't have to deal with as much guilt? Just gas and go.
470,"January  9, 2004 10:34AM",cybersol,"Well, first of all, horsepower has little to do with acceleration, its all about top speed. Acceleration is about torque, and not just peak torque, but the whole area under the torque curve. The TL achieves 238 lb.ft. @ 5000 rpm while the BMW achieves 214 lb.ft. @ 3500 rpm. So there is only 24 lb. ft. of difference in the peak torque, but the bmw acheives it much earlier. An earlier torque peak generally means a much broader and flatter torque curve in general (less peaky). It also generally means less peak hp, which explains the large hp difference.And second of all, the engine is not alone, power is tramsitted to the ground via the gearing of the transmission and the final drive axle. Gear spacing affects acceleration by allowing the engine to stay longer between its peak torque and peak hp. The first gear ratio also needs to be selected so as to deliver maximum power without overpowering the wheels and tires that will deliver the force to the ground.All that being said, I listed the BMW, G35, and TL because they are approximately equal in all the acceleration testing I have seen. There seems to be just as large a variation in the times of different G35s, for instance, as there is a variation between the three different models."
471,"January  9, 2004  1:02PM",riez,"The RX is based on the Camry.The IS300's ""lowish"" highway fuel economy estimate is due to its gearing.  It does not use a very deep overdrive 5th gear.  I'd prefer a deeper overdrive, but you hardly have to shift out of 5th in order to pass.  The IS300 is performance car, not an economy car.  Designed for drivers who even want performance in 5th gear? Just compare the gearing in the Camry and RX versus the IS300 (taking into account both final drive ratio and the individual ratio of each gear).If you want to complain, check out the mileage differences between the 325i and 330i.  The less powerful 325i isn't very fuel efficient.  And part of that problem is tied to its gearing (as well as a smallish engine for the car's weight)."

For me it was a good commuter car, certainly not comfortable for long rides, and not quick enough to toy with people stoplight to stoplight. It handled well, but no better than the A4 I had. I bought it used for a great price, and I must say it was damn reliable, but above all this the reason I got rid of it was because of the type of people that drive them. Most, not all, are juveniles, or act like it and swear up and down its the best vehicle since the Model T was introduced.

However, in the pursuit of automotive excellence the press provides a function in determining in a more unbiased fashion, than you or I debating the merits of a particular vehicle or aspect of a vehicle.The reason I posted that information, is to show in contrary to some other opinions that the 3-series is a has-been, the automotive press still regards it as a benchmark in the world of entry level luxury sport sedans. This is not in one magazines opinions, but others as well. Looking at automotive opinions is just one way of level setting the conversation.Now you could go say you don't believe that vehicle is for you or that it doesn't have any value to you, or other vehicles do some aspects in the world of sports sedans better.

Does BMW think the other buyers aren't smart enough to figure it out?  Or do they know something about their buyers that we don't?But guess what percentage of 3 Series, esp. sedans, are sold with automatics?  Bet it is at least 60 percent.  And what percentage of 3 Series sedans have Sport Package?  Doubt it is over 25 percent.  And what percentage of sedans are both manual transmission and Sport Package?

Lets not forget the TL v G 1/4 mile and 0-100 numbers....At 4 grand with WOT the G IS as fast as an M3 until 6K  This does not make it a better car than an M3.  The bang for buck is exactly where you say it isn't in the G.  When you go for another drive notice it has almost a turbo lag until about 3200 rmp - and then thrust city.  Your statement is quite absurd IMO.  At 4k the thing is worth BMW money and I may have paid it.  ""TL has 270HP 3.2 that is 84.3 HP per litter and G35 260hp 3.5 is about 74.3 HP per litter. I drove G35 and it feels like the engine is dying after 4000 RPM, that is not what you want if you want to experience performance of a RWD at high speed, on the other hand TL 3.2 comes alive after about 3500 RPM, to me it makes all the difference. ""Take a look at torque numbers per litre for each.  While you are waiting to come alive I've been thrusting down the pike and showing you my led's!""Are you saying the 3 is no longer the benchmark and that MB, Audi, Jaguar and others are studying the G35 now? I doubt the germans will ever emulate the japanese - too bad for many reasons too but I am saying the G35 is teh benchmark now.  Look at the New GS lexus shows at the detriot show I believe for 2006.  Looks like the G has had an impact for the next generation in design.  Did you see the rear quarter - they may get sued.Look at the numbers look at the design and the reliablity.  Hell if you dont like the interior as much as i love my willow leather and titanium then wait 12 months and see what happens.  The benchmark should not lose to a first timer in performance, be smaller and cost more while in the same class and be considered anything but playing catch up ala the 3.8i v8 3 series coming soon (with a G competitive price too).Is there that much of a difference in G over three - NO NO NO.  It's simply my argument that that 3 being a benchmark is yesterdays hype still rolling with powerful marketing intertia.  The 3 is great no G owner want to take that away from anyone...it's just not the only one anymore and not the best by the performance numbers.  If there is something else besides great numbers and looks to pay for I'm not sure I'm going to pay BMW prices for it.  I think some people just like that germanic intangible - you get it in a Golf too and to me it conjures up reliabillity issues that seem to pervade every german automaker relentelessly and consistenly.  See Bllueguys comments as a 3 owner.Also the benchmark should not be overlooked by a comepitors cross shopping as the 3 is when G cross shopppers look at the 5 as an alternative.I'd say the 5 is the benchmark the G strives to become over the next five years and the 3 becomes more inline with the is-300 and accord and saab.  Is it pricing or size that matters when class comparing?Audi and Jag could stand to learn from someone.  The audi4 is a passat and the Jag is a mondeo.Caddy is better than all but 3 and G.

I apologize for the formatting but it was a copy and paste. My point here is that sometimes we get overly enthusiastic about what we own and start quoting what we believe to be true in terms of performance, etc. All of these are fine cars and we all have different reasons for buying them.These are 2003 models. The TL stats have improved for the TL because of the new model. I believe the 330i and the G35 are consistent with the 2004 models as they are running the same motors as 2003 in 2004 ? The recent Edmunds test for the 04 TL had 0-60 in 6.5 and 1/4 mile in 14.9. G35 for 2004 was 0-60 in 6.1 and 1/4 mile in 14.7. I know the 330i 0-60 was almost identical to the TL. There were some 5.7 times reported for both in recent articles.The 2003 comparison showed the 330i with the fastest 0-60 time of 6.3. You can find different reviews of these cars with different 0-60 and 1/4 mile times. I believe this is explained by track conditions, tires and skill of the individuals doing the driving. The bottom line for me is that I think you can throw a blanket over these cars in terms of performance in a straight line. It will depend on who is at the wheel. I guess I am disputing the post above which states everyone else will be seeing the LED's of the G 35.A really interesting part of the test which I had not seen before was the run through the 600 ft slalom course. The 330i won by edging out the A4 and both of these were 2 mph faster than the others. The G35 was last. I don't know if the G35 made changes to suspension or tires for 04. I just re read the Edmunds test for the 04 TL and the TL went through at 67 mph this year. Quite an improvement from the 03 TL-s 61.3 mph. Edmunds said it was ""one of the fastest cars we've ever taken through the cones"". As a TL owner it shows me that perhaps the rhetoric I constantly hear about RWD being much better handling isn't necessarily true in all instances.I am looking forward to the ""shoot out"" articles that are surely coming in the auto mags. At least it frames the conversations in facts and data and away from opinion."
528,"January 27, 2004  5:17PM",kdshapiro,"raher - just to cite an example. Cars improve every year, so it would be no surprise a FWD of 1980 would be bested by a FWD of 2004. However, having said that, I would like to see how the new ZHP stacks up with the G35 with the SP against the new TL. In the same comparo. Chances are they will best the FWD because of the weight distribution.It is my belief that the average driver can get more out of a FWD than a RWD. But a RWD driver who has taken performance classes can extract more out of the RWD than a skilled driver can extract out of the FWD.So to your point, there are advantages and disadvantages of each."
529,"January 27, 2004  5:18PM",billyperks,"That test did not do justice to the Type S.Emunds compared apples to oranges.The Type S was an automatic while the Bimmer and the G were rowing their gears manually.If all the cars were automatic across the board the TL would have won hands down.I am only standing up for the car I own, not trying to make any point.Justice served."

532,"January 27, 2004  5:49PM",kdshapiro,"I actually agree with you in the light HP duty class. That is one of the advantages of FWD. But the horsepower race is on: 400 hp to front wheel? Not sure about that. No problem with RWD. But we are talking Near Luxury, not GP. In the world of Near Luxury street legal cars, it's a different story.So yes, cars like the mini will shine in certain situations due to it's overall small chassis, which is aided by the fact FWD has a smaller footprint. But they are inhertently hp limited.In terms of the topic, I stand by my assertion talking Near Luxury sport(y) sedans."

Since FWD is for many more than RWD this car should be fine for those folks - there are some more discerning sprts sedan drivers who will avoid this myself included.  Driving dynamics are a serious issue in my book and only RWD covers all the performance bases.  FWD is too compromising and the reason in the article are stated up front.  They are physical laws that cannot be avoided even by japansese engineers at Honda.There were other comments on edmunds that the TL is great as long as you dont drive an accord first and get a taste of the platform with about the right amount of power and all the great reason to buy an acura but for alot less.And again, why should the G without SP upgrades be compared to 3 with upgrades.  I still will take my chances in 5AT form against one on track and god knows i would in 6MT form.  Lets see the G35 with a performance package and then we'll compare again.  Someone mentioned the G was shooting for the stars...dam right and getting there quickly - this is year #2 folks and 5 series has been here for how long.  Keep in mind that at 3900 pounds the and similarly sized as G the G is much faster and equally as fast as the 540i.

534,"January 27, 2004  6:14PM",raher,"The main point of my post was to emphasize that enthusiasm for the cars we own often clouds reality and opinion is stated as fact. Edmunds didn't say their slalom test result for the TL was good for a FWD car..they said it was one of the fastest they had ever tested.. period. As to race track performance, one of the previous posts said it best...3 series and Integra battle it out for championships in SCCA racing in that class. Your opinion of the G35 is no substitute for facts. Stating that in 99% of the tests you have seen the G35 wins 0-60 and 0-100 doesn't mean anything unless you have an example.What tests , where. I am sure the G35 has come out on top in some tests just as the 330i has and the TL. I stand by my original statement..you can throw a blanket over them for straight line performance. The differences are in 1/10's of a second. Having gearing that emphasizes torque or speed in 3rd versus 2nd or 4th doesn't matter if you are measuring 0-60 or 0-100 since elapsed time is what is being measured.Gearing is more important on a race track since the car has to be set up to maximize speed within the confines of the circuit. Having a 160 mph top speed doesn't get you much if the straight only allows 140 mph top end.I know the G35 is a great car. I would have bought the coupe but my wife couldn't live with two doors. That doesn't mean it is the end all $30K to $40K sedan however as you keep insisting in your posts."

You are right which is why IN CLASS I picked the G.I am not in the market for a very well placed and put together econo box.  Im in my 30's and dont want another car in the driveway.Performance; looks; value; size; tortional rigidity; price; and class without tude, and service are my bullets for purchase.

I think I'd expect the results you described for your car.  Do you have an auto?  Read the stats - none of the 04 cars mentioned (545 notwithstanding) are going to be THAT different really.  My points about the G are in context of being the new benchmark as opposed to the 3.

The G interior was purposefully not too posh - rather industrial and not trying to be BMW while beating the 330i - killing the auto 330i in any timed run, outhandling the 330i, mathcing the 330zhp in handling, beating the 530 matching the 540..and I CAN compare the 5 - the luxury goodies aside the cars have VERY similar sized wheelbases, and displacement.  It does not ride as nicely and it's louder and more Z like...thats what i paid for.  What do two different cars start with...frame and drivetrain...all else can be stripped out as far as I'm concered except one seat and a steering wheel.  What then - cant compare becasue if you get outhandled and outpaced it's not fair......."

Two miles down the road both of them were pulled over by a cop.  The 330 was still in front. I passed them both. So which car is faster? My wife&#146;s Accord.

There is room on this planet for all the vehicles in this class, each with a different aspect of prowess.The G is faster, despite most automotive magazines opinion that they are at least in the same ballpark. The G can be directly compared to the new 5 series, due to the wheelbase. The G has a more visceral feel than the 3/5 series. And the G outhandles and outpaces every 3 series including the M3. But please take this lightly we are all here to have a good time."

Adding a supercharger to the M3, ZHP, with suspension upgrades, would get a commesurate increase in power/handling capabilities as well.

The platforms,  horsepower notwithstanding, are the basis for the argument that the 3 is now bested.  It's not a stretch to see why when you look at the global accolades this platform gets.  I'd take plain z and a carrera to the track anyday and take my chances in either.  That car shares 90% of underpinnings with G.  The engine HP wars don't mean a dam thing here you are changing the subject.  The platforms being compared are in the same class and the accolades falling on the G and her cousins are telling - with non M type of upgrades KD.  As for the A-spec - still FWD - still low torque - its only another 30hp - another 30 over the accord's that make it 60 too many.  I bet those fat sweet tires will help - what are those 295/21's??"

Simple truth is, the G or Z will never reach the pinacle of true vehicle perfection that the 3 once had. Nothing could touch it for four or so years there. The 3 series is an old car, the G is much newer. The fact that the 3 series kept atop the extremely competitive automobile industry for so long is a testament to just how good this car really is. As long as BMW doesnt screw this car up, i am sure the next 3 series will blow every competing vehicle away once again. I personally feel that the advantages of having a G35 over a 3 series is one: price, and two: having a much more rare car. I hardly ever get to see a G, while i probably see two 3 series everytime i go out."

The M3 is still untouchable. In your fervor to proclaim the 3 series dead, you are comparing a two seater to a 4 seater and citing references to products not being sold in the US.

587,"January 29, 2004  3:03AM",rderizans,"FWIW, I've read the posts over the last few days with some amusement.  What a great world we live in if you've got 30-40k to spend on a car, huh?  BMW, Audi, Infiniti, Acura, Caddy...whatever, things just keep getting better, huh?I just traded my 99 328i (E46) for a G35x.  I absolutely loved the 328i, but the ABS pump went and I figured the $2500 repair price was a good excuse to go shopping.  Before that, the car was rock-solid.  Never a problem, really.The G35x was just the best value for me out there.  It's beautiful (IMHO, of course), has AWD, and a GREAT engine (with more power, but not as smooth-revving as my BMW), while also giving me more room than my BMW.  Oh, and it was about $6k less than the comparable 3-series today (330ix), although I don't think the $6k is all prestige - there's definitely something special about a 3.I test-drove the Acura TL and it's a pretty amazing bargain.  Didn't care for the FWD feel or the dealers in my area or I'd probably be driving one today.  Interior is AMAZING.  Puts Infiniti and BMW to shame.  During my test drives, for what it's worth, the engine didn't feel as good as the G35's, but a test drive isn't a great place to evaluate such things.  Cars need about several thousand miles on them before the engines loosen up.Anyway, the BMW (with sport and summer tires)felt lighter and more agile than my new G35x, but the G35x feels more powerful and rides better.  Both are awesome cars.One other note about all of the posted ""tests"" from magazines.  I love reading about cars, but the comparos really are sometimes apples to oranges.  For example, BMWs are always tested with the sport package and summer tires (usually Pilots). Most other cars are tested with all-season tires.  Mention is rarely made of that difference.  It certainly must account for some of the skidpad and steering response results.  In BMW's defense, they have the guts to put top-flite performance tires on their cars so they should get credit...not like the crap Turanza EL42s that came on my G35x.Anyhow, my overall point is that after having owned a BMW 3 for over five years and extensively test driving an Audi A4, Acura TL, and G35x, I can say that I honestly think I could have been incredibly happy with any of these four cars.  If Caddy can get their build-quality up I'm sure they will be another player.  For those who don't think there's something special about a 3-series BMW, you really need to own one for a while.  I fell in love and might very well find myself back in a BMW down the line.  The g35x is a different and amazing car, though, and for me, it's the best of what's out there today.  Heck, even if you're looking in the 25k range you have the Passat, Mazda6, Accord, Altima, and Camry!Whatever you choose in whichever class, what a GREAT time to be car shopping!!!"

Before their demise they had a test in which the Audi S6 (Euro model only), XJR (pre 04) and M5 were competing with a used to be untouchable Ferrari, the 512TR, which started out as the Testarossa in the 1980's, and guess what...the M5 beat the Ferrari in every measure.

Some of the benefits to owning and driving today's advanced luxury performance cars are lost to horrendous road conditions. And yet, some of the automakers are designing more cars as if we all drove on race track like roads every day. Here's a good example taken from a recent Car & Driver road test of the new BMW Z4:""The one major flaw is the way in which the steering wheel dances wildly in your hands from road undulations. This is the downside of the Z4's newfound handling acumen. The taut tuning and unyielding run-flat tires of the Sport-package car mean every truck trough, pavement cyst, and chuckhole takes a yank at the front wheels and, hence, the steering wheel. Versions with the standard suspension should have less bump steer, but all Z4s come with run-flat tires.

FWD cars when driven hard over heat the front tires and start to push more and more. The torque steer requires more driver effort/attention to manage. Anyone who has raced FWD cars has to learn how to manage the tires and the inevitable mid race increase in push. A RWD car takes a lot less effort to drive at speed and puts less load on the front tires. As so many have pointed out already there is so much more to cars that what can be measured with 0-60 or a 600ft slalom course. If you took 10 highly skilled drivers and asked them which car (TL or 330) they would take for a little 2 hour race (TL vs 330) I would be surprised if any of them choose the TL. I raced FWD cars for 10 years and I know what car I would take.

It does make a difference, I think, but much more so on the 325i than the 330i.  The suspension on the 330i is the same, regardless of whether you get the sport package or not (it already has the upgraded suspension).  The only chassis-related difference is wheels (same 17"" size, though, I think) and, of course, bigger summer performance tires.The 325i has a softer base suspension.Don't get me wrong - the BMW sport pkg (seats!)is great (I had a '99 328i that I just traded in a few weeks ago).  I'm just saying that it probably doesn't ""transform"" the car as much as people are saying in the case of the 330i or the coupes (which also come standard with the firmer suspension).  And, anyone who has driven a 325i without the sport package and claims it ISN'T fun and still dynamically head-and-shoulders above most of the competition hasn't really driven one.

Hey, y'all had me fooled to the point where I left behind RWD cars in 1979 and didn't start driving them again until 1999.  So, I'll start out with a few well chosen words regarding how much better FWD cars perform in snow vs. RWD cars:1) Assuming the assertion is in fact true, who cares?  I mean, how much snow do you  really drive in anyway?2) Sorry guys, it just ain't so.According to a very interesting test run a couple of years back by one of the car magazines, it is in fact true that under light acceleration, the FWD car will perform better in snow than an otherwise similar RWD car.  Unfortunately for the FWD crowd, that's where the performance advantages end.  RWD cars, with their naturally better balance (ie. fore/aft weight distribution) reigned supreme in the handling and braking department (AWD cars were a different story, however, the RWD cars, with their lighter relative weight still stopped better).  After all, who cares about getting going if you cannot stop or turn?I am now driving a RWD car with a nearly perfect 50/50 weight distribution, traction control and winter tires, and I can say without a doubt that it is the finest winter weather driving car I have ever driven.

By the way, when you talk about being addicted to these boards, I find that one of the best things about the internet, as part of it&#146;s incredible significance to mankind, is the catharsis that has come about with regard to the formerly lost art of letter writing. This art is once again alive, better than ever, with an immediacy that was hardly imaginable not too long ago. I always encourage the kids to play less with computer games, read and write more often the net has amazing education value. Somehow I&#146;m thinking of my adolescence now. There are black leather jackets, pompadours, cockroach-killer shoes with taps, the Beach Boys, and dreams of Corvettes. And pinging along with the screws that have come loose in my head is the wisdom of my fellow Bronx denizens, a philosophical variety that, no doubt, originated either there or in Brooklyn. It goes something like this ""Hey designman, I got your catharsis RIGHT HERE!""Speedracer3, I'm wondering where I fit in with that BMW stereotype. As a three-car owner, I'll definitely be cross-shopping therapists.;-)"

716,"February  5, 2004  6:17PM",jrock65,"2004 Estimated 3-year Resale Values (source: ALG)1) BMW: 54.5%2) Lexus: 53.2%3) Acura: 52.1%4) MB: 52%5) Audi: 51.2%6) Infiniti: 51.1%I got a question.  If the average BMW sells for  95% of MSRP, and the average Infiniti sells for 90% of MSRP, aren't real world resale values approximately the same (51.1/90 = 54.5/95 = 57%)?"
717,"February  5, 2004  6:29PM",riez,"jrock65... Those are purely ""guestimates"". The actual numbers won't be know for years when real owners go to sell their cars or trade them in.  The industry has done a horrible job projecting depreciation (which impacts both leases and non-lease purchases) for the past decade or more.  Trend had been to inflate.  Plus manufacturers sometimes artificially inflate residual in order to subsidize the lease.  Then they take a bath 3 years down road when their dealers are wholesaling the lease returns.Realized depreciation really best applies to the person who buys the car new and then sells it later.  Their actual realized depreciation is the difference between what they actually paid (which is usually below MSRP) and what they actual get for resale (which is usually below the published books).  MSRP is normally meaningless to depreciation unless that is the price paid at time of purchase."
718,"February  5, 2004  6:59PM",jrock65,"Yes, these are estimates, but I don't believe that they're worthless.  If I'm buying a car now, there's no way to know for sure what it'll sell for in the future.  These estimates do serve as some sort of guide, however imperfect they are.The tense of my question should be in the future tense."
719,"February  5, 2004  7:03PM",riez,"Guess it really depends on whether you plan on leasing or buying and how long you plan on keeping the car.  These guestimates won't matter a whit if you buy the car outright, keep it for a decade, and drive the wheels off of it.  Nor will they matter if you are leasing and get a great subsidized lease deal from the manufacturer, where they deliberately over-estimate residuals in order to lower less payment.Of course, these estimates do matter when it comes to calculating a lease deal today.  But I've never leased and can't imagine ever doing so.But I also think these estimates can be dangerous for people who buy and then plan on trading in or selling off their car in say 2-5 years. These numbers are almost always over what you will actually receive from a dealer or private party.  To be safe, deduct at least an extra 10% if not more like 25%.Give you an example.  On 11/30/01 I bought a CPO '98 540i6.  Had about 52K miles.  Original MSRP was around $58K.  I paid about $36K.  I traded her in 9/03 at about 78K miles.  Got about $19K from dealer.  So my actual depreciation for the 22 months and 26K miles I owned her was about $17K.  The dealer who bought it from me sold it for about $22K.  So the car at 78K miles/5 years was worth a bit over a 1/3 what she went for new/actually paid in '98."

Their sales of cars plummetted, esp. cars like SC430 and IS300.  The GX470 SUV had huge growth.  The RX330 is the big seller (something like 92,000 units.)  In less than 5 years Lexus' SUVs went from about 0% to over 50% of sales! Huge reason BMW is pushing X3 and X5.

745,"February 11, 2004  1:12PM",riez,"mariner7...  My only points are (1) SUVs have become a clear trend even in premium marques like BMW and Lexus, (2) there can be intra-marque sales competition (e.g., the X3 and 3 Series take sales from each other as do the RX330 and ES330), (3) there is inter-marque competiton (potential buyers who didn't like the new 7 Series might go for the S Class or people who think the 330i is too expensive might buy a G35), and (4) you have to take into account general economic and social trends (e.g., in general recessions cause sales to fall and buyers have moved away from sedans and station wagons into SUVs and light trucks).All four factors must be evaluated when comparing a particular marque's sales over time as well as a specific model within that marque over time."

Some quotes from www.carkeys.co.uk Road TestSubaru Legacy 3.0Rn  No Longer An Outcastby Ross Finlay (10 Nov 03)In previous years, Subaru's suggestion that with the latest Legacy it's targeting the ""leading prestige European marques"" would have seemed like PR spin from Cloud Cuckoo Land. But since the 2004 model range offers smoothed-out exterior styling, greatly improved interior presentation, a more powerful top-of-the-range engine and even more precise handling, you'd better believe it.Subaru may not be the class of the field when it comes to premium badge recognition, but the lighter-weight 2004 model, which goes on sale this month, sits even more four-square on the road thanks to its wider track, modified suspension and lowered powertrain.Together with revisions to the steering and brakes, lower front and rear roll centres, and the advantage of four-wheel drive, all this means that the top-rated 3.0R feels to have similarly priced European saloons and estates beaten hands-down for handling.I can't think of any immediate competitors at prices in the mid-£20,000 to £30,000 range which could match them for poise and traction on winding or hilly roads.The three-litre Legacy is the best-balanced car in its class. Driven briskly, it's stable and precise on corners, and there's no need to throw it about rather than hold it on line. Out on the open road, anybody who feels the VDC cutting in - unless during an emergency attempt to miss the tractor - ought to blush at being so ham-handed.As I said before, if you have driven a Legacy you know you don't have to worry about keeping up with Audi's, BMW's, G35's or TL's in the twisties. The 3.0r might be getting the 6spd MT from the STI according to Subdriven.com"

We're talking a marginal weight penalty and if the engineers designed it as a convertible from the start, then the chassis flex is not that much of a difference.  10-20 years ago this wasn't true.  Today many sports cars are made from the ground up as convertibles - Z8, Viper, etc.there is an oxy moron factor there that suggests that these buyers aren't that into performance in the first place. If you want to scoot around quickly in style with some rigitidy the a-4 will work pretty well I'd think.Have you seen the times on that bloated cow?  It's a 4k lbs beast with an underwhelming engine.Nobody is seriously challenging BMW's dominance of 4 place entry lux RWD convertibles.  We know buyers are grabbing up G35 coupes and sedans.  So a convertible is the next sensible step in Infiniti's quest to steal BMW's thunder. Weird, I'm the BMW owner here and you guys seem to think it's a bad idea for Infiniti to offer a RWD convertible 4 place sports coupe."

The IS300 is overdrive.  The IS300's overdrive just isn't very deep (believe it is around .85).  There are some exceptions.  BMW tends to use a non-overdrive 5th gear in their close ratio boxes, but has also used an overdrive in their wide ratio boxes.You also have to factor in the differential's final drive ratio.  The higher the number the quicker the acceleration (but the lower the top speed).  The wonders of engine torque multiplication!The value of the ""top gear"" data is in regard to showing whether you'll have to downshift in order to pass.

In Europe, the company is offering deals like free air conditioning to move a large inventory of Golfs, and similar measures are anticipated in North America. VW stock initially rose 2.7 percent Wednesday, but then gave ground and closed at 39.33 euros ($50.49) or less than one percent in Frankfurt. Shares are down 11 percent since early January. VW is offering discounted finance rates and leases in North America, but has stayed away from big rebates. Most models have rebates of just $500. And it is facing pressure from dealers to be more generous on discounts to move aging models like the New Beetle (five years old), Golf and Jetta (six years old), and Passat (five years old). VW's discounts are more in line with Japanese and European imports than with U.S. automakers.

I was very familiar with VW/Audi products way before I owned one (I hang out at VWvortex a lot). I chose Audi because they are better made and more reliable than their VW counterparts. So far I've had a terrific ownership experience with my A4.  Sorry to hear that you had a bad experience."

846,"February 24, 2004  3:00AM",bxd20,"Well, engineering can overcome certain aspects of FWD (torque steer elimination by careful axle length design, wheel spin out of corners with an LSD) but no engineering can overcome the laws of physics.I think we're all familiar with a tire's contact patch.  All forces work through it.  When you expect the front two tires to deal with lateral forces of turning AND acceleration/decceleration, the tire becomes overburdened more quickly than with RWD where the fronts just have to roll along and steer.This type of performance handicap doesn't show up in most performance tests.  Acceleration numbers are all straight-line.  Skidpad g's are maximized under light throttle adjustments, so it doesn't show up too much there.  In slalom, a car's ""normal"" transient behavior is explored and how quickly it can shift back and forth, but the driver is hardly turning left and right in a way that fully collapses the suspension.  More importantly though, just like the skidpad tests, the slalom is done with just enough throttle to maintain a smoothe constant speed.If you want to see where RWD reigns superior over FWD, look at track lapping times.  This is where the driver must brake hard, turn in, and blast through and out of the corner.  The RWD will be able to get on the gas earlier and harder and gain tenths through the corners.  This mimics aggressive street driving more closely than any skidpad/slalom.Brian"

I would be willing to bet that the Integra you cite did not have the same power to weight ratio as those RWD cars.  My point was -all else being equal- a RWD chassis will be faster around a track.When super-car builders (Ferrari, Ford GT, Lambo) set out to build an exotic high end sports car, they do so with very little concern for cost.  If FWD was inherently equal to or better than RWD, why wouldn't one of them have tried it already?  Is Honda on to some sort of voo-doo front wheel drive that nobody else knows about?And reading over C&D's comparo, it sounds like Acura still has a ways to go till they have the TL handling at its full potential.  It finished third because of a wonderful interior and much more power than anybody else.  For -me-, the interior is almost irrelevant, any car in this class is good enough.  The straight line power is intoxicating and enticing.  I smell a mild suspension update in the next year or two for the TL.Brian"

Because they have a lot of time to play with their car or even going to a race track. I was young too.In my mid 30s, I prefer half sport and half comfort, but if I am over 45, I might go for a total comfort/luxury car.If you try Nissan maxima or Integra GSR you will feel a noticeable understeer. I am not saying that understeer doesnt exist in a TL but you cant hardly feel it unless you really go too far. ""This time Acura has done a bit too far for a FWD car"" quoted. Do you know what they meant by saying that? I tried Nissan maxima and 2000 Integra GSR (and its nothing compared to TL), and it's totally a different experience but still better than the previous altima. There are 5 current report that gave the nod to the new TL, do you think they all dont know about understeer?. Performance rating in a scale of 1 to 10, RWD may get a 10 while normal FWD usually get 6. If a FWD can get an 8 (G35=10,BMW=9, TL=8), for me that's more than enough while it gets more rating for luxury/comfort/styling/acceleration/snow/mpg/resale value/ maintenance cost, considering that people dont take on corner very often in their life or doing it in a race track. Besides road styles, traffics in everyday's life dont support those kind of adventure.I buy a car according to my need just like everyone else. 96% normal driving with less than 5% taking on corners which is hardly to find in  these days without getting into trouble or heavy traffic on it.Btw I like the new G35 coupe."

872,"February 25, 2004  5:00PM",raher,"I have been staying out of here for awhile but have been reading most everything. One of my observations is that there are very few women participating. The posts about women could take on on another aspect...do your wives or women friends drive your car and what do they think about the TL and others? Most of the posts here are from men and are performance oriented. Women are responsible for a large portion of the money spent in our economies. I recently read a report that said they were responsible for the majority of the discretionary money spent.I bought our new TL for my wife. It is the third car I have purchased for her. She never test drives them or participates in the selection. All three have been Acura's. A '91 Legend, a 2000 TL and now an '04 TL. I always look for a car that is a cross between sport and luxury. I am the sport, she is the luxury. She loves the new TL, including the 270 HP. She isn't out racing but is in the car all day driving ( sales job ). The power comes on gradually and is very predictable.She loves the ""near luxury"" especially the seats and the stereo. The NAV is an absolute necessity as she is constantly having to drive to unfamiliar places. The real thing is she looks very nice in that silver/ebony car and people are constantly telling her what a nice car she drives. On the weekends I get to use the sport piece of the equation. The new TL is a perfect blend for the two of us. After 36 years of marriage I have a pretty good idea of what her expectations are. I laughed when I read the thread about ""old people"" ( anyone over 30 evidently )not pushing their cars but buying cushy luxury cars. Not always so. I am 58 and still enjoy driving fast and aggressive where it is safe to do so. I started road racing motorcycles at 38. My brother is 60 and has a V8 powered Triumph TR7. Next time your at a light and the guy next to you is in a BMW/TL/??? he may just be like me and decide to have a go. Paul Newman raced well into his 60's.Bottom line...the new sport/luxury cars are a reflection of what people want to buy and in most instances the people who can afford them are older than 30 !"

If you have a lot of money to blow, then you probably are considering a Porsche 911.  But let's say your budget doesn't allow that and you're looking to spend $50k.  At that price point, I would be looking at cars such as used M5s, new M3s, a Z06, a CTS-V.  I wouldn't ""demerit"" the sedans just because they're sedans.  I'd look at overall performance and upon doing so I'd see that the M5 and CTS-V BELONG in the company of ""sports cars"".  If I compare those two sedans against what that money buys me at a Porsche dealer (a Boxster), I would actually be taking a step down on the performance scale.  Why?

As for the sound thing, I'm baffled as to why people think it's out of sorts to want your car to be whisper quiet on the inside.  Currently I drive a 2003 330i with the Performance Package.  The muffler makes a constant, droning rasp that reminds me of my sister's first Miata on long drives to So Cal with the top down.  The other bimmers I've ridden in are quieter but still there's too much road and wind and engine noise.  It's not too hard to figure out what I prefer given what I bought.  The G35 came in 3rd in my choices as I didn't dig the sloppy suspension or typical truck-like Nissan manual.  Acura's TL with a 6 speed probably would have come in second as I would have even taken a TSX 6 speed over the G35.  Nothing else was even close as, the Lexus IS bored me with numb steering, a lackluster engine and a very, very bad image in so cal (teen brats drive IS300s around here - the rich kids Jetta\?Accord).  Audi's A4 lacks any sort of punch and it has fwd or its god-awful power-sapping quattro (plus I was dropping a VW as they make horrible cars).  MB's C class is a joke in terms of handling and power.

That's the beauty of the human body.  Its just like the old trick of not being able to fully taste something when you can't smell it.if its too quiet, you can't tell what is going on.  By the pull of the engine?  Ok, so how does that translate as to when to shift?  When it stops pulling that means you've hit the rev limiter, so you should shift??  This is one of those things that you should be careful what you ask for because you might get it.  I am sure that if you got your wish and had a completely silent car, you wouldn't have a clue what is going on without looking at the guages.  Maybe after quite some time with the car, you could get used to what speed objects are traveling past you to trigger your shifting, but it would not be intuitive from the start and would take alot of conditioning.  I am driving a perfect example now.  I am currently stuck with a rental 2004 Maxima with the shiftronic.  I can't tell what the heck that thing is doing without looking at the tach because it is so quiet.

It's not as silent as I'd preferred, but it's more so than the 330. However, nimble and agile it is not. No offense to any Maxima fans, but I feel it's not much better than my '87 Integra in term of handling. I knew I would make compromises by going with the Max, but now I think would be much happier with the 330. Oh well, you live and learn."

But the ergonomics are horrible.  I don't know who they designed these seats for.  And forget about changing the climate controls while driving.

If I've got my stereo blasting there's no way in hades I can hear my engine but I can definitely feel on BMW's peaky engines where the car's at in the torque curve.  Slight pull is under 3k.  Little thrust is up to 4k.  Press you back in the seat is over 5k.  Given the very distinct build in power of BMW's inline 6, it's cake to tell where you are on the tach."

Unlike the G, TSX and BMW 330i, I wasn't smiling while driving the IS... actually I only wanted to get out of it both times.  The desperation of the Lexus dealership who dropped the price to invoice made me uneasy as they called back over and over with lower offers.  He was begging me to buy the car.  Creepy.

The dealership seemed really enamored with it being a Caddy.  When he asked if I'd buy one I said it lacked the punch and sublime road feel of the German targets.  This tool asserted the CTS competes against no one as it's a Caddy.  Okay, I guess only pimps would be interested in it then...dunno.

To come out and dictate that GM and Ford *should* be driven to extinction is quite rude.  Let's assume for a minute that Caddy's are 100% trash.  Why not let market forces cause GM sales to dive and cause bankruptcy?  Isn't that what America stands for, the free market?  At one point in history, the cars your beloved Honda was making would have elicited nothing but laughs from performance enthusiasts.  Yet notice how far they have come because of competition.I agree your experience at the dealership leaves much to be desired.  Although it does not excuse their behavior, you have to remember that Cadillac is, fairly successfully compared to say Lincoln, trying to shift their demographic to a more youthful group.  Old ways are hard to change unfortunately.That said, I have been treated poorly at a Lexus dealership.  They were all quite smug acting as if their IS300 was the only sport sedan in town.  So I think this attitude comes from certain sales people and not the brand.When I said ""raw power"", I meant to convey the general ""pull"", or ""kick"" of the car, especially as a reference to 0 to 60 feel.  Sorry wrong choice of words.Also, that 220 you quote is for the 3.2 CTS.  The new 3.6 is 255 hp / 252 lb ft torque.  That's why I said earlier it will be in the same ballpark as the fastest other RWDs in this class.  Of course that's all ""paper racing"", it will be interesting to see what MT or C&D say.Brian"

Not only is it exceptionally tight and precise, with just the right level of power assist at all speeds, but it gives immaculate feedback, as well.  The steering wheel itself is fat but small in diameter, and with no supplemental controls save the [AT] gearshift buttons, it's nicely uncluttered, as well.  It's perfectly capable of communicating precise information about how much grip is available from the front, what the road surface is doing to the chassi, how much angle is dialed into the wheels, etc.""They said it had ""superior steering"" over the 330Ci.Remember, this is a biased BMW source.

And the saddest thing about having traded my two Infiniti a few years back was losing the great dealership and wonderful customer service.  We got to know the staff personally.Say what you will about their cars, but Lexus and Infiniti have worked hard to dominate the dealership ratings for nearly 15 consecutive years, by most sources.  Their customer service is rarely second to anyone else in the car business."

In an attempt to add another one,  some of the local boys took an old Rambler and painted it the same color yellow. They built a wing out of scrap lumber and screwed it on the trunk. A rudimentary nose was formed out of some plywood. When they were done, after very little thought, they christen it the sh1t bird.  On the weekends they would cruise the town looking for the real yellow bird and park next to it whenever possible. The only person who didn't enjoy the joke was the real bird's owner."

They are consistently harder on BMW and their mistakes than any other source that I personally read.  If I remember correctly, that comparison involved an early production 330Ci with the ""new"" steering.  It took about 6 months before BMW, realizing the mistake, switched back to the ""old"" steering.  FWIW, I bought an 01/01 production 330Ci and took part in BMW's steering retro offer.

Old ways are hard to change unfortunately.That's like saying compared to Manson, John Wayne Gacey was sorta sane.  No matter what they're still American companies and I'll freely admit I'm biased.  I will buy Japanese and German but it'd take something mindblowing to ever get me to buy American.They said it had ""superior steering"" over the 330Ci.Remember, this is a biased BMW source. I'd say that is high praise indeed! Riez, are they buying my car for me?  No.  then why should I get something I find to offer numb steering?

When you don't hear, or feel, the cracks in the road and your brain is used to doing so, it might be interpreting that as meaning Avalon-like handling.Brian"
917,"February 27, 2004  2:44PM",95gt,I sort of agreed with you up until you said you went with an A4. I would say for 30+ k (40 if you really load it up) the A4 is very lacking in the power department. I have ridden and driven them and they feel way too underpowered. Handle like a dream and look great but for that kind of dough they should have more power. I think everyone agrees that the BMW is a overpriced  but everyone also seems to agree that it is a great car. I would have loved to have one but could not afford the extra money for the 330 (went with a CL-S) and the 325 was just too slow for me. Sadly i think BMW sells so much because so many people buy them for status and the more they raise the price the more people seem to want them.
918,"February 27, 2004  2:54PM",shipo,"There are plenty of differences between the 325i and the 330 beyond just the engine.  For starters how about the transmission (yes, it is different), suspension, brakes, wheels and tires, power memory seat (left side), power seat (right side), upgraded audio system and of course the ever important trip computer.Regarding the ""same poor BMW reliability"", ummm, yeah right.  Hate to burst your bubble, however, all scientific and anecdotal evidence suggests that the Audi line is considerably worse.  Contrast that with my personal experience of over five years of BMW driving and so far, I have had two burned out taillights.  Now, I realize that the Lexus crowd would be aghast at how unreliable my cars have been, but personally, I can live with that.  ;-)As for what's a rip off, and what&#146;s an insults one's intelligence, well, one could say that the only car that wasn't an insult would be a completely utilitarian car which will get one from point A to point B and nothing more.Best Regards,Shipo"

I am poiting out to Blue that reliabilitywise the 325 and 330 are the same car. BTW...I've had two Beemers in my family and they were always in shop with electrical glitches.

It's the same car, same tranny, same poor BMW reliability.Actually I have a short-shift 6 speed.  Again not the same.  Oh and different suspension and different wheels and different differential.  Different chip programming.  Lets toss in wholly different exhaust system and headers/cams.  Oh and my speed is limited to 155 (which I hope one day to try out on a track) rather than 123 (I believe that's the ceiling for the 3 series normally) and my redline is 6800 which is higher than a 325i.  In addition to the performance upgrades from the 325i to the 330i ZHP,  I also got a few luxury features I've grown to love...memory seats, tilt mirror.  Useless fluff to some but the difference between me happily leaving my car for a wash and being annoyed I have to adjust everything back. And unless you are a stoplight racer for a living the 0-60mph difference is inconcequential. I don't know where you live but in So Cal we have annoying freeway lights.  100-200 feet to go from zero to 75.  Am I a stop light racer?  No.  Do i consistently shift my in the upper region where the engine sings.  Redline shifts are common for me on every drive.  I bought a performance sedan and I make it perform.  I often cruise in 3rd of 4th at around 80 mph so that when the need arises I can punch it and take off.  This cannot be done with a 325i.  Ask my bro-in-law as he and his 325i simply cannot keep up with my bone stock car.The 325i has enough power to move that car very well. I personally, think they are both a ripoff, and that's why I went with an A4...but the 330 is by far the biggest insult to one's intelligence. To each his own.  The A4 doesn't offer the handling (especially a FWD one) or power I want when spending over 30k for a car.  There's no reason I should EVER have to worry about merging or will I have enough power to shoot a gap if I'm in a near luxury sport sedan.  With the A4 (I had a 1.8T) the engine pulls pretty well but not with the ferocious authority I'd expect paying over 30k.  Go Quattro and an already slow car is now saddled by an inefficient drivetrain that saps power like crazy.  Add the tiptronic and the car's dead in the water.We all have priorities.  Mine were performance, luxury and fun for a price I found reasonable.  As the 325i only offered good handling it didn't meet my performance to price ratio.  I'd gladly blow 40k again on my sedan as it's a grin producer.  The 325i wasn't that big of a step up from my old Jetta. I couldn't rationalize spending 30-32k for a 325i that would leave me constantly annoyed at the lack of punch."

That still leaves you with a car with smaller brakes, smaller engine, and a 5-Speed transmission instead of the 6-Speed on the 330i.Is $4,630 too much for all of that?  For me, it's worth it, for someone else it's not.  Is it a rip-off?  I don't think so.Regarding the reliability, like virtually every manufacturer in the world, the reliability has improved dramatically in recent years, and statistically speaking, the E39 and E46 cars have improved to such an extent that they are among the best.

Without this package the cars are essentially the same, and the same options can be added to either. Listen, it is your money, to me it makes no sense. Let's agree to disagree. I think the 330 in base form is a bigger ripoff than the 325i. BTW...I don't have Quattro or Tiptronic. Mine is a 1.8T Frontrack and CVT.

That's a typical misrepresentation of the facts.  BMW owners do it too.  Get a 330i and then add the sport package and 18 inch rims and wheels.  At this point you're now talking about a 2k difference for an engine that's modified, modded tranny, different suspension, different interior/exterior treatment.  Heck Acura and G35 owners pay 2k just to get cosmetic changes to their cars!Mine is a 1.8T Frontrack and CVT. The car pulls with tremendous authority and the CVT is a awesome tranny.

I couldn't live with a CVT or the 1.8T engine again.  They're gorgeous cars with excellent interiors and the 1.8T pulls nicely.  But I love the neck-snapping ability mixed with the docile nature I can get.  With a shift to 3rd I can go from 60 to 95 in a blink and transform my comfy little cruiser into a brutish thug.  That's part of why I love my Jekyll and Hyde car.  If only BMW let us get that 3.2 in our 330i's...sigh...M3 sedan, yummy."

When it comes to what I prefer with my money I don't even understand how you'd have the temerity to toss up journalists as to proof a vehicle should feel a certain way to me.  I never said the rest of the world should bow down to the BMW or Acura or any car.  I expressed my opinion on what was worth my money.  Why would I or anyone else take into consideration what dozens of others might have indicated in their published reports when you have spoken? I honestly don't know why anyone believes a word written in car mags.  Or reviews of anything.  I judge for myself and make my decision from there.  Experience for yourself and build your opinions from that.  Repeating quotes from car mags is nothing more than parroting the opinions of someone else.  You can tell me X car is horrible but I must experience it for myself.Good example, I'm a huge movie buff.  I've had netflix for near 4 years.  I see movies constantly (watch zero TV) and because of my love for film I'll give just about everything a shot - b movies, iranian film, japanese, so-called bombs, etc.  With some friends one night we saw an ad for Swept Away on pay-per-view.  The common consensus among critics it was horrible.  Someone snorted, ""who would see that?!""  I said I had on DVD and it was quite bad.  Another friend added, ""Leave it to you to confirm that the universally hated film was bad.""  It wasn't good enough that others liked it or disliked it, I had to experience it firsthand.There can be differences in two cars. Often one test drive isn't enough. Some specific single cars are lemons. Others just aren't up to the rest. Deviations from the mean. That's why I've driven two of them.  You can keep trying but in my experience with the IS300, the car felt numb and disconnected.  The engine didn't offer the power I prefer.

928,"February 28, 2004  3:00PM",riez,"blueguydotcom...  Having owned a '98 540i6 and a '00 323ia, I have some appreciation for BMW steering systems.  I've also test driven 318ti, E39 525i, E46 325xi, Z3, X5, E65 745i, etc.  (Have you ever done the Susan B. Kosman Drive for the Cure?  It is a blast.)  I didn't mind fact E39 540i used recirculating ball instead of rack & pinion in the E39 525i/530i.  Both work quite well.  But I also own two IS300s, an automatic and a manual.  The steering in the IS is every bit as good as that in the E39 or E46 BMWs.  It is not numb.  Nor disconnected.  And if it is, then I guess so, too, must be the BMWs?This is opinion based on actual comparative ownership.  Not just a short test drive or two.

The sheet metal will not change but the front and rear bumpers will be totally redone and incorporate the aero kits, or something very similar to them, on both the coupe and sedan models. For those of you with 03 model sedans that have been wanting to buy an aero kit Infiniti has just reduced the price 23%. They are closing them out because next year they will be standard.3.

It's also a more accurate comparison to compare sales in the same month of the preceeding year since there is an annual ebb and flow to car sales in general.  Winter is not exactly the best time to sell a sports coupe or a convertible, for example.G35 sedan sales up 42% from Feb 2003 sales of 2,410.  That comparison is more meaningful.I'm sure the TL did much better this month when compared to its sales in Feb 2003, but you also have to consider it is an outgoing model vs. a brand new model comparision.After two years in the market, with all of the complaints about the lack of a manual in its first year, plus ongoing criticisms of the interior (some valid, some not), whether or not the styling will remain ""fresh"", the G continues to sell."

For many Nissan buyers, the Maxima is a viable alternative to the G35 if one is willing to sacrifices some sport for room and FWD (for snow), and is not willing to pay extra for AWD.  A fully loaded Maxima and a G35 offer similar features for almost the same price.BMW sold 2492 325i and 467 330i.  This isn't surprising since the 3 is near the end of its model run.  Sales will pick up when the next 3 is introduced, but BMW will have to do an excellent job.  The TL has been a big success, the G35 will only get better with the redone interior, and Lexus seems serious about the next IS. 3-series domination is no longer a gimme in this segment, as it once used to be.merc1,He didn't say when the 05 G35 would be released.

The C&D comparo found the TL to be faster 0 to 60, but the average of the entire sample of tests seems to say that the two cars are a dead heat 0 to 60, and the G35 is slightly faster in the 1/4 mile.""G35 is not as well equipped like TL""Depends.  The G has some features that the TL lacks, and vice versa.  Personally, I prefer the exclusive features of the G, since Bluetooth, DVD-audio, and voice operation (Navi isn't worth it) is useless to me.""G35 is cheaper than TL""The base G is cheaper than the TL.  But very, very few people get the base G.  Similarly configured, the G35 costs a bit more.  But I would think that this is a plus for the TL, not a minus.""G35 is not as luxy as TL""If by ""luxy"" you mean better interior, then yes.""G35 does sell less than TL""No doubt about it.""G35 is not as high tech as TL""Yes, the TL has more ""high tech"" features.Again, I really like the TL and would personally get it over the G35 (depending on how good the 2005 G35 interior changes are.)

The TL looks better (imo), has a better interior, is a hair faster, is fwd (+/- depending) and has more features. The G35 handles better, stops better, and is rwd (+/- depending).  I think it's really pointless to argue reliability here.  Neither will match that ""other"" Japanese luxury brand, per the surveys.  They are both competing for 2nd place here. Price is pretty much a non-issue too, at least around here. I think it comes down to whether you want more luxury/features or more performance (straight-line speed isn't everything) and rwd handling characteristics. Neither one of these cars clobbers the other overall. M"

I still think the G35 coupe is darn sexy and love that angry snarl when you hit it. My old 94' Prelude Vtec was a blast to drive and also had that snarl when the Vtec kicked in around 4500 rpm.  I think Acura finally is coming back to life after being neglected by the parent company for so long.

Last weekend 3 people approached me about the car - at a Blockbuster, at the gas station (I get the most questions/comments there it seems) and parking on the street in Pacific Beach.  I still don't see many 330i ZHPs on the road so it could be that it looks different enough from the standard 3 that people are curious.  I know many women have asked what model my BMW is as they like it. Maybe a standard 3 wouldn't get so many comments.   Shrug.

It's amazing where all this money is coming from.  The next hot car is the G35, I see a dozen of those cars each way.  I am starting to see a few more of the new TL's. I have noticed 2 or 3 new ones traveling in every morning.  One thing is very interesting, I noticed that the G35 drivers are fairly courteous, never competitive. When I ride in the Aero Wagon and an Audi or BMW pull up,  sometimes I get competitive power on. I always nod to the M3's and M5's, but it's the new 7 series drivers that always show out."
971,"March  4, 2004 12:52AM",fedlawman,"My cousin just bought a Nissan Titan full-size pickup...nice truck! The interior is fresh and modern, without being too contrived (unlike the G35 and Maxima). the plastics and switchgear are kinda cheap, but oh well...I must admit I've never seen the FX or Murano interior in person so I can't comment on their quality, but I was referring to the common styling theme that Nissan is following right now. Overall, it's not where I would want to spend much time.I like BMW's so much (pre-Bangle) because their design/styling is purposeful. They look and feel the way they do because it's the most efficient way for the car to go about it's business...no unecessary scoops, curves, grooves, etc.As for my TSX...I'm loving it. Now that it's got some miles on the clock, the engine has really opened up and it breathes like a sprinter. I swear if it didn't have a fuel cut-off at 7500, it would zing up to 10,000 without a problem! The cold temperatures also make a big difference with that big I-4! I love downshifting to 3rd behind  slow-moving traffic, and sling-shotting out and around. This car has some serious midrange grunt...no need for 4 cyl apologies here.I'm taking my TSX to another BMW CCA track event later this month. Hopefully, I can grind down those all-season Michelins enough to justify some new shoes (Yoko's?) before the summer. It took a little getting used to the drive-by-wire throttle, but I've finally got heel-and-toe down in the TSX, and it is so sweet! And yes, it does have that gorgeous interior and slick 6-speed that I never grow tired of.  I sometimes regret not biting the bullet and getting the BMW, not so much for it's driving experience, since the TSX satisfies very nicely. It's just that I originally wanted something different (non-Japanese), and my smarter side ruled against it. You know, what I really want is a cherry, 1989 325is to play with (sport suspension, BBS rims...oohhh). It really is the best sport sedan BMW ever made (or at least, my favorite) and I'd buy one tomorrow if it crossed my path!Like you, my sport sedan only comes out on weekends, so it is much more fun to drive because every drive ""feels like the first time.""I must tell you though, we got a new Volvo V70 for munchkins in January and I really enjoy driving it!

975,"March  4, 2004  7:53AM",victord1,"I believe I posted a message sometime waaaaaaay back, about six months ago, about my personal experience with both cars. My sister and I own both the '03 Max SE and '03 TL-S. The TL-S has slight advantages in handling, smoother ride, smoother engine at high RPM, and possibly exterior look. I like the Max interior ergonomics, quieter engine, smoother trans/engine interactions (both cars have slush box), and bigger size.To most people, both cars are about equal overall, except for $2,000-$4,000 differences in prices, w/incentives on the Max. Now I haven't test-driven the '04 TL yet, but I assume that the new smaller size and slightly more powerful engine would increase its performance/handling potentials even further. I tested the '04 Max the first day it arrived in the dealer and noticed that while the engine was even smoother/quieter than the '03 and the drive had been improved with the new rear ind. suspension set-up, the car's bigger size reduced the handling part to just marginally better than the '03. And don't even get me started with the new interior.......what the heck were they thinking?!?!When the new '06 BMW 3series come out in late '05, I'll probably trade in the Max for the ""older"" version '05 3's. Personally I think the current 3series has the best overall exterior look (especially in titanium silver) and the size is just about right for me--yes, I've grown tired of the bigger Max. Now if I can only get pass the BMW reliability issues......oh well, then there's always a TL :-)"

The TSX is an Euro Accord, and the TL ( I see the old Civic tailights on this car) is just a larger version of it. What I liked about the G35 is that no current Nissan car looks remotely like it.

While I might not have thought this if I drove just the 325, after driving the 330 the 325 power seemed nice, but not great. Of course, in most cases, not a real issue. I'm off (in the near future) to drive a G35x.  On paper, looks like I can have 330 power for less than 325 price, at a higher level of equipment (cd changer, leather, and still less than the 325). Recent years' reliability looks comparable.Nothing else looks close to these two to me (Audi has some reliability issues, I think.

I recommended the car to him, he bought the car before it came out as production.  By the end of its cycle, I couldn't stand the sight of that car, to me the design aged really badly."

To me it seems that while Acura has moved the new TL closer to the BMW 3series, Nissan did just the opposite with the new Max. For someone who's looking for a family sedan with room and power to spare, the Max is an excellent choice. However, for a single guy like me who likes corners and twisties, a more agile and smaller sedan would be more preferable.When it's time for my trade-up, the only cars I have in mind are the new TL , the G35/G35X, possibly the up-coming 250Hp AWD Subaru (for the AWD factor), and the 3series as the most favorite.

986,"March  4, 2004  7:14PM",designman,"What I like about the G35 is the overall shape... numero uno in judging appearance IMO. It has a fluid airfoil shape, similar to the 911. Also, none of the details and proportions scream for attention. I think they could have done a better job with the headlights and grille though. Headlights say Maxima, grille says Cadillac.TL has subtle details but is too wedgy and chunky in the rear. Accordingly the shape is a bit unbalanced. And that swathe running just beneath the beltline looks like an afterthought... incongruous. I'd bet they added that near the deadline after thinking the car looked too vertical... to give the impression of less height. The wedge works better with smaller cars like TSX and RSX. By the way, on the Acura website, they do a great job of reducing the chunky rear with lighting notice how dark the bumper is in all shots. But when it comes out into real available light, the butt is very large. I&#146;m sure the TL is going to be a winner, but I think it would have been dead-nuts perfect by reducing the angle of the wedge a bit. The wedge may say sport, but it does not say elegance larger sedans have to keep it to a minimum.Not totally happy, but I&#146;ll take either one of these cars on looks for the most part there is harmony and order to the details and lines no unnecessary topography. They sure do beat the Bangle bimmers."

As usual, the Temple of VTEC will be in attendance, delivering full coverage. Just recently we've heard some information from several diverse sources and the info seems to be fairly solid. Some of the stuff has already been ""confirmed"" (by logical interpretation of public statements), but some of it is new. In the first category is the drivetrain - we can say with virtually 100% certainty that it will be a V6 with AWD. The AWD system will almost certainly be based upon the Pilot/MDX's VTM system. One source (in our own forums) goes a step further and reports that the standard torque biasing will be 70/30 front to rear. Current horsepower estimates peg the car at around 300hp. We've heard a number of figures on displacement ranging from 3.4 to 3.8L, but our best guess is that it will use a 3.5L variant of the TL's motor. IMA does not seem to be a part of the equation at the time of launch. Other interesting tidbits: the RL will feature fairly extensive use of aluminum body panels: roof, hood, and trunklid. The car will also continue to build upon Acura's renewed emphasis on performance. The car is said to perform as well or better than the hot '04 TL (recall the TL 6MT's very impressive skidpad and slalom figures). Based upon our sources, it seems the car will be positioned lower than where earlier rumors had it pegged (those rumors indicated it would be a true 7-series, S-class or Lexus LS competitor). While the TL is positioned against the 5-series (yet priced like a 3-series), the RL will very likely fall somewhere in between the 5-series and 7-series in size. Pricing will probably not deviate too far from the current RL's pricing, and the content level will build upon the TL's segment-blasting features. We've heard a few reports that luxury items such as power adjusted rear seats will appear on the RL. It's our understanding that the car's audio system was not developed with ELS. I will personally be surprised if it surpasses the TL's superb ELS system. As in past Legend/RL models, the car's development was carried out almost entirely in Japan and it will be built there as well."

Current horsepower estimates peg the car at around 300hp.I hope that's a misprint and they meant 30 front, 70 rear.  What sort of fool would want a performance sedan with 70% of the power going through the wrong wheels?"
999,"March  5, 2004  7:47PM",raher,"What sort of fool would want a performance sedan with 70% of the power going through the wrong wheels?Maybe the same ""fools"" who are helping set sales records for FWD cars. Maybe you need to ask yourself what qualifies you to call anyone a fool based on your opinion of what constitutes a performance sedan. This board is full of posts with statistics on performance and handling of FWD, RWD and AWD and in the end there is very little actual difference in the objective facts. Most of the differences are opinions held by individuals who seem to lack respect for someone elses opinion. I drive a FWD performance sedan and I am no fool."
1000,"March  5, 2004  7:57PM",blueguydotcom,"If you have AWD, then the safety reasons people opt for FWD are now null.  With that safety element now gone, there's no reason for Acura to retard the car's performance with the majority of the power running through the front wheels by default.  AWD would allow Acura to finally move away from that which keeps many buyers at bay.  You seem enamored with sales numbers so maybe this would appeal to you: if Acura offers a performance sedan that finally drives like a performance sedan while also offering a drive system that meets the ""safety"" needs of the FWD buyers, Acura could increase sales.  Suddenly, two camps now see value where before only one group of buyers would.  I have nothing against FWD buyers.  I do have a problem with a manufacturer finally taking a step toward making a performance sedan by switching to AWD but then curtailing the vehicle's performance by keeping power going through the steering wheels. AWD properly set up on a TL would get my business and probably that of many others.  FWD on the TL will not.  They could have 500 HP coming out of that car and it could cut through the slalom at 90 mph.  I still wouldn't buy it as my primary fun car as it just doesn't cut it for me anymore."
1001,"March  5, 2004  8:41PM",raher,"I am not enamored by sales statistics. They do however point out whether a company is making money at what they are doing, assuming their cost elements are being met. They also show whether consumers are buying their product. From Acura's perspective, they have always built FWD cars and they have always been able to sell them. The fact that TL sales are up 57% lets Acura know they don't have to make any major changes to their manufacturing facilities by switching to RWD or AWD. Assuming their market share will increase by switching to another drivetrain is a risk they may not be willing to assume since they are already increasing sales. It will always be about making money for the major manufacturers.Sales usually dictate changes. The RL has fallen way behind in the luxury class because it has not kept pace with the competition. The consumer has dictated that Acura make changes or get out of that market segment. Acura engineers have decided that a 70 - 30 split is what they want to do for their AWD. I guess they forgot to consult you prior to their decision but they seem to have an enviable track record making decision on their own.It's all about choices and how those choices do or do not succeed in the marketplace. I don't think you can objectively prove that a given split is ideal for every AWD car."

But I hope the manufacturer keeps upgrading the car as others do too, getting fat and lazy was what happened with Acura the Legend.As for FWD as long as it does the job, I am fine with it. It is one of the best handling(ranks 3rd) in C&D but overall it ranks first to most magazines. It is a lot better than Integra GSR. FWD doesnt make people unable to take a fast corner right, especially with LSD, VSA, TCS in TL. And I think with AWD, TL will be MORE unstoppable. The fact is even with FWD, the sales is unstoppable already. but thats just my opinion."

I'm planning on getting my car by the end of April... though last night after I wrote a thought came to my head... I remember that the 03 TLs had some transmition problems in both the S and the regular... IS it fixed with the new TL has anyone been plagued with similar problems...

At this point, thankfully, it's all conjecture and there is no official confirmation that the RL will have a ridiculous 70/30 split.And Subaru's pretty much proven a 30/70 split front/rear allows the WRX Sti to marry blistering acceleration with superb cornering as oversteer can finally be induced (something that was nigh impossible with the normal WRX).doesnt make people unable to take a fast corner right, especially with LSD, VSA, TCS in TL.

1011,"March  5, 2004 11:08PM",jrock65,"I would disagree with you.  Sales are AN indicator of quality, but not the sole indicator of quality.Of course, low quality products from say, Ford or GM, can sell in high numbers, but there are other factors that go into sales, such as marketing, low prices and incentives, and customer loyalty.  I would guarantee you that as crappy as some of the Ford or GM products are, if they made cars of Yugo quality, they wouldn't sell nearly as well.A perfect example of this is Hyundai.  When they first came out, they sold like hotcakes mainly because they were cheap.  Then all sorts of problems with quality surfaced, and sales plummeted.  Then Hyundai started to gradually increase the quality of its products, and sales are on the rise again.But I agree with your general point that high sales don't automatically equate to high quality."

You are inserting something that was not any part of what was being discussed. I certainly hope Acura consults you prior to doing anything as stupid as deciding on their own what the best split is for their AWD. God forbid they would utilize their own engineering history and experience.99.9 % of the general public buying and driving performance sedans will never drive their cars to anywhere near their limits. They will however probably drive in snow and rain and make their buying decisions based on those kinds of factors.There are a small percentage of drivers who do enjoy driving their cars near the limit. They tend to gravitate towards sites such as these. That is not however a true reflection of the general buying public. It is why FWD cars still sell as well as they do and why AWD cars sell as well as they do. Racers and enthusiasts choose RWD or AWD because they are going to push their cars to the limits and RWD is the best drive train for driving on the edge. I just don't believe the majority is driving close enough to the limit to really benefit. Automakers make cars for the majority because they have to stay in business.

I guess we'll just have to disagree and leave it at that.In any case, I for one am glad that the TL is FWD.  I definitely feel that RWD is more fun to drive and that FWD has its limits, but some people want a sporty experience in a FWD setup (for foul weather purposes), and are not willing to pay the extra $2000 or so to get AWD, and its associated decrease in gas mileage.It just makes more economical sense for Honda to make the TL FWD, since platform sharing with the Accord and the TSX helps keep costs down.  They don't make a single RWD sedan yet.  Even though Honda/Acura NA sells more cars than Nissan/Infiniti NA, Nissan is a significantly bigger company in Japan than Honda."

I bought up several and resold them in online auctions for 200-300% over MSRP.  The people buying them obviously felt the toy was worth $800-900 because they bid up to that point.  I'm not going to tell them they're wrong but what i valued and what they valued were different. To somebody out there, the A-spec may be worth 40k.  Hard to imagine but it's possible.  Just as it's hard for some to imagine blowing 40k on a 3 Series.  To each his own.  In the end shouldn't we buy that vehicle we feel most comfortable driving?"

You cant value TL for just $25k bcuz 6k people/month would disagree while maybe only 467 people would agree to it. You like the car the way you like it, why we should care about others.

1043,"March  8, 2004  1:22PM",qbrozen,"danny reported a few posts back the A-spec is $5900 installed.  A far cry from the $10K originally quoted that started this current discussion.  And if that autoweek number is correct, that's a Navi equipped unit, correct?  I think that adds up.  $35K+ for the car and $5900 for the package = over $41K.  So can we now stop saying things like ""$45K for a TL"", ""33% more"", ""$10K more"", etc?  At least until Acura makes the numbers public or we have a more reliable source.  I see that motortrend has reported testing the A-spec and they support the $5200+install number.  According to them, you get the following:an aero kit that incorporates a front air dam, small chin spoiler, body side skirts, and a choice of two different rear spoilers--a small trunklid spoiler or a larger (yet still tasteful) rear wing. The aero kit was wind-tunnel tested and produces more downforce while generating a slightly improved overall Cd.A-SPEC badging flanks the body panels, and the TL's well-trimmed interior is left alone save for a recontoured, slightly thicker racing-style steering wheel.more aggressive suspension tuningMost visible are the 18x8.5-inch alloy wheels and grippy 235/40VR18 Yokohama AVS ES100 tires.The rest of the underpinning mods include a track-tuned shock and coil-spring combo that lowers ride height by one inch. Special attention was paid to spring rate and shock valving to ensure sportier handling without the tradeoff of a harsh on-highway ride.and some more tidbits from their article:In A-SPEC form, both torque steer and understeer are dramatically reduced--we even experienced an occasional hint of oversteer on aggressive corner turn-in. Braking performance from the factory-installed Brembo four-piston disc brakes improves, too, thanks to reduced nosedive during hard stops and the stickier rubber.The A-SPEC package was not only developed under Acura's umbrella, but the added cost ($5200 plus installation) can be rolled directly into the purchase or lease price. Finally, the factory warranty remains unviolated.and the numbers?  Stock vs. A-specBraking, 60-0, ft 141 119 Slalom, mph  62.5  66.1 Skidpad, g  0.77  0.83now, question, does anyone have published numbers for a non-ZHP 330 vs. a ZHP 330 and the total price difference?  Now, we're not talking the Peformance Pack, right?  No engine mods.  Unless the engine mods and suspension mods come in around $6K.  Do they?  No more time for me to search today, so maybe someone can do that for me."

1045,"March  8, 2004  1:33PM",qbrozen,"just remember that is only one source.  Interestingly enough, C&D got very close to those Motortrend A-spec numbers with their STOCK TL.  So, interpret that how you will.  I'm willing to bet that Motortrends stock numbers are a bit conservative and make that A-spec package look way better than it is in real life.  A .06 improvement in skidpad is pretty incredible.  A .02 (C&Ds stock number vs. motortrends a-spec number) seems much more realistic to me."

Looks like the guy that paid $45K may have done just that.I also don't think Autoweek makes up MSRP's. The A-Spec is overpriced at the price point where Autoweek tested it."
1047,"March  8, 2004  2:54PM",chrisboth,I would expect much better numbers as the tsx and the rsx are capable of those numbers.  Hell the old integra could skidpad .77.

BMW claimed the ZHP dropped the zero to 60 numbers to 5.9 (tests by mags get it lower) v. the official 6.5 of the 330i (check bmwusa.com for that). I'll have to do some digging for the numbers.

Sure some here or there will know what it means and want to pay more but most likely you will eat that cost. Either way would love to have the package but the cost is pretty high
1065,"March  8, 2004  8:58PM",chrisboth,"Do it yourself and dont pay someone to make mods to your car or do them one at time.  Maybe some will want the body packages and the ASPEC buyers will be there for those who just want a newer looking or cooler looking car.  All the performance stuff anyone can do anywhere without much help.  The funnest thing of owning a G has been minor tweaks and little money that create small incrimental gains that I can notice and tweak.  Do one and then do another down the road while appreciating each tweak on its own is my philosophy.   I would suggest most of us would rather buy the car without a perf pack and make the mods ourselves.  The ZHP is an exception as it offers some big changes to a luxo car to get it to be alot differet.  For 200 bucks I added 10-14 Hp with an intake.  For another 120 I added no real gains with my Hyper Grounding Kit but added much smoothness and better responsiveness while eliminating the gurgle the intake created.  For another 450 I bought a Crawford Z car intake plenum which adds 20hp.  So for less than 1k I got about 20-25 HP at peak, increased the sound quality of the motor, get better gas mileage (4-5 mpg), have a smoother idle and start up and I don't have the HP drop at 6000.If they offered a $6000 nismo package I' say no, do the perf mods myself and save $5000 on body kit bolt ons that will never work out as well as if bolted on at the plant in the first place.Now I belive I am running Z power at the crank anyway - weight diff is about 150#.  Anyone see the Z in the lastest C&D.  They got a 13.8 1/4 running stock at 102 or so.  Everytime they test the FM seems faster and faster!  Break in alone is good for 20hp I'd bet with the VQ."
1066,"March  8, 2004  9:42PM",shipo,"I am of two minds on this one.  In most cases, I would be inclined to buy the base car and then tweak it myself, most likely after the manufacturers' warranty expired.  That said, between the 325i and the 330i, and again between the 330i and the 330i ZHP, one would be hard pressed to match the full package of the more expensive car for the same money, to say nothing of having a factory warranty on the extra goodies.  So, in the case of the 3-Series, I'd be more inclined to go with the factory upgrade.Best Regards,Shipo"
1067,"March  8, 2004 10:58PM",blueguydotcom,Another funny thing about the 330i to ZHP switch: it's really a crazy number of mods for only $2800 if one were to buy a 330i and get the sports package ($1200).
1068,"March  8, 2004 11:27PM",jrock65,"Well, apparently the ZHP package is popular enough that they're putting it on the coupe and convertible as well.I'm not sure why Infiniti is nixing Nismo, especially since they're going for the Japanese BMW image (everything RWD or AWD, handling a priority, etc.)  Most boy racer kids won't be able to afford it anyway."
1069,"March  8, 2004 11:35PM",shipo,"Okay, fair enough, I hadn't considered that the difference between the 330i SP and the 330i ZHP was considerably less than just the cost of the ZHP.  As such, I went through and configured the three as I would have ordered them.325i, 5-Speed, Metallic Paint, Leather, PP, SP, Harmon Kardon: $36,595330i, 6-Speed, Metallic Paint, PP, SP, Xenon: $41,570330i, 6-Speed, Metallic Paint, ZHP, Leather, Moon Roof, Xenon: 43,470So, in the ""As I would buy it"" configuration, the 330i comes at a $4,975 premium.  Fairly substantial, however, IMHO, the considerable power gain, coupled with the 6-Speed transmission, bigger brakes, and bigger wheels and tires easily justify the price.Then there is the 330i to 330i ZHP difference of only $1,900, a no-brainer on a car listing at over $40K.Best Regards,Shipo"

So, far, the U.S. distributor has been shipped more than 700 sets of high performance suspension, wheel, and exhaust packages for the 350Z. And ideally, the company would like to send the same sport goodies for the Infiniti G35 coupe (known as the Nissan Skyline coupe in Japan).Because, hey, this Nismo Skyline developed together with Sony's Gran Turismo people looks pretty damn good.

His intelligent rejoinder, ""This is a Caddy.""  Yeah, some things never change.Here's the bottom line... the CTS-V will annhilate any one of these also rans. It's in a complete other world as a performance car. And I hope you didn't pay $43K for that weak BMW... you got screwed if you did.I never pay sticker.  But then again, it shocks me people would pay 35k, let alone 40-45k for a Vette.  To each his own.  To me the Caddy is scraping the bottom of the barrel.A poseur if there ever was one.That makes no sense.  I'm a poseur because I refuse to line the coffers of companies I want to go out of business?  I'd say if I bought from Ford/GM I'd lose tremendous face as I have lobbied hard for them to go under.  And will not go back on my word."

I know that is atypical but I think it shows that you can get a good or bad anything.The 5.9 V8 has been great. The Chrysler V12 that has been at the auto shows looks very interesting.I also own an 04 TL which my wife drives and I have always owned Acura passenger cars.I think the numbers on quality in CR show that America is getting there.

I just try to buy affordable fun cars. The CTS-V appears to be a ton of car for the money. To each his own.  It's American.  I will not put my money there.You might not want to check out the latest CR. They pound MB, Audi, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mini, and VW for poor reliability. And they cite the A6 and 7 Series as repeat offenders. They list the 7 Series ('97-'99 and '00-'02) and X5 ('00-'02) as used cars to avoid.With good reason.  I never said Germans build reliable cars.  Never.The 3 Series now has average reliability. Which is an improvement(!), so they can now recommend it. Is that damning with faint praise?I didn't buy my car for reliability and frankly knew going in my BMW would probably be troublesome (which it hasn't been).  Didn't much care as I bought the car I felt the best driving.But BMW can't hold a candle to Infiniti or Lexus.For reliability, that's true.  But that played no part in my buying decision. I've owned other German cars that were a nightmare.  I'll keep coming back as they're just more entertaining.Not sure why anyone would want a $40-43K 330i instead of an M3. They are too close in price to favor the loaded 330i. 1. M3 is a 2 door.  I will not own a 2 door unless it's a convertible.  If there were a 4 door M I'd buy it.  2. M3 with the bare essentials (Xenon and Moonroof) stickers at 50k.  50k for a car that's a design I don't like and doesn't offer the utility I desire?  No thanks."

Wouldn't be surprised if their reliability rivals the Japanese Big 3 in a few more years.Mercedes languishing in the back as usual.

So the line needs to be somewhere.  Yes, the TL and 330 can be optioned out above $40K, but they start far below that, as already pointed out."

1141,"March 10, 2004  1:09PM",chrisboth,Infiniti and Lexus are thw two top IMO for reliability.  I pay to own and when I plunk down 35 large I'd like to at least have the opportunity to own the car for 7 years and then decide if it's fun and reliable enough to keep for a second car.  What are the odds of that happening with the Chevy 9-3 Vector or the BMW 3 series or the A-4 or the Caddy.  With Infiniti I honestly believe I may have a shot of going 10 years.  Thats 5 years of no payment!  Or one hell of an upgrade in 5-7.  Only the Lexus and TL would cross my mind as possible long term ownership possibities.  If you there was a million dollar cannonball run across the US what car would you want from this category?  I'd take a G or Hummer!edit...Of course the NIssan Crank sensor recall had better be checked or you may get stranded....(didn't affect my car in reality)

You have to have a sports car or superfast sedan or a police car or ambulance or something stealty.  The Real cannonballers with cars and trucks alike usually used additional fule storage tanks.  The G puts the stock tank under the rear seat so there could be a modification that allowed for more storage....hmmm.  Also the intake plenum upgrade I did got me to about 28 mpg on the hiway.  Great modPS the cars that have won cannoballs include a caddy so the sedan thing is a good possibility in our little hypothetical.If the ran one today you'd spend 100k to mod the car.

Does anyone have any specifics as to what is so unreliable about this truck or are you all making big assumptions?

I am always open to new or improved models from different Companies. There have been various types of vehicles that have been driven by either my wife and I or my parents over the last 10yrs                      ( CLK430,LS400,RX300,ES300,Thunderbird,Firebird, Grand am,Audi A6,G35coupe)Best in terms of Quality and Reliability = LS400This car was driven hard for about 70K and there were no  mechanical problems and no rattles or squeaking noises like what came with my CLK430,G35coupe Another endorsement for Lexus... The RX300 has 186,000 miles with no major problems other than routine MaintenanceLets take a look at some of the others...89 Firebird purchased used. I had several expensive problems until I finally sold the money pit and used the proceeds for a down payment on my wife's wedding ring. I guess the wife won that battle.94 thunderbird...What can I say other than CRAP! It died at 76K. Too many problems to list.CLK430 had it's share of rattles and fuse shortages. It was handed in with 80K and a transmission problem. Thank God it was a lease.G35coupe It only has 8K but the minor squeaks from different areas in the car can be annoying at times. I am very happy with the car but we just did not have these issues with any of the lexus vehicles listed above.Audi A6.. Let me state the positive first. It handled very well in the snow. Better than any other vehicle I have driven including the RX300. Unfortunately the car is the definition of what a Lemon is. Can anyone say Fuse Out! The same fuse went out 3 times. The car also failed to start on atleast 3-4 occasions. The first happened at a funeral. What timing! The list goes on but I think my point is made...Yes, I agree if you want a sport sedan you should look somewhere else other than Lexus but when it comes to well made reliable cars, I would have to give lexus 1st.

1166,"March 11, 2004  2:37AM",shipo,"...regarding ""Near Luxury Performance Sedans"".As a point of reference, I drive a 2002 530i 5-Speed with enough extra goodies to have brought the MSRP up to nearly $49,000.  That said, I got a good deal and did the European Delivery thing which resulted in a final price of just south of $43,000.  That of course does not count the cost of the European trip, but I would have taken it anyway (and rented a car while I was there).From my point of view, my car completely meets my needs, wants and desires.  It's fun to drive, economical (31 mpg on the highway), reliable (two years old and no unscheduled trips to the dealership), good looking inside and out, luxurious, certainly fast enough to get my attention, and capable enough to deal with it's power and ability to go fast.  What do I mean by that last bit?  On the autobahn during my ED trip, I was tooling along at the speed limiter (128.5 mph) when a motorcycle pulled out directly in front of me doing something like 60 mph.  I performed an emergency lane change (unfortunately when he saw me in the mirror he did the same, keeping him directly in my sights), and then performed what could best be described as an anchor dropping test of the brakes.  At our closest we only got within two feet of each other (him under full acceleration and me in panic stop mode) so he still had a little margin for his error and as such, he lived for another day (hopefully).Having said all of that, I have been reading here that there are certain cars of a similar price and size with bigger (if not substantially bigger) motors that are ""superior"" vehicles for the money.  Uh-huh, right.  I suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar cars with smaller engines, and I suppose to their way of thinking, it is.  To my way of thinking, that's the easy part, and that it's the rest of the package that makes the ""Upgraded"" car truly superior.  Would a CTS-V for instance, have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation?  Unknown, but I suspect that the CTS-V is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias, and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver.Balance, that's what the BMW offers, and yes, on paper it will certainly cost more for what you seem to get.  So, if I had it to do all over again, and if I was faced with the choice of a CTS-V or my 530i for about the same price, what would I choose?  Probably the BMW.  Call me naïve, call me dumb, call me wasteful, call me a poseur, call me whatever you like.  I can live with that.  ;-)Best Regards,Shipo"

I think the numbers and actual dynamics of both cars are good but there is a consistently better performance margin from the G which would indicate ease of manuevering in same situation.  And we've beat the brakes thing to death.  The BMW is more forgiving and not as sport as the barely entry lux G.  Doubt there much to disagree with other than preference there.  Both cars on the autobahn are better than any caddy - so far...Shipo hit it on the head pretty well with the stuffing a big motor in it doesn't make it better...I was dissapointed in what i've discovered about the CTSV and would hope a 300hp 6 and a better interor was in the making."

Not trying to pick a fight, however, the manual transmission version of the 530i weighs in at only 96 pounds more than a three pedal G35 Sedan; that's not even a tank of gas.  That said, the SP on my 530i includes 235 section width tires as opposed to the 215 tires that come on the G35, my guess is that the extra inch of tire width will at least offset the whopping 96 pound weight difference.  Call it a draw.Regarding my comment about another car acquitting itself as well as my car did in the situation I found myself in, you will notice that I was referring a (presumably) nose heavy CTS-V and not the G35.

It turned in like Marshall Faulk cutting for the goal line, and if its weight transfer wasn't quite as smoothly managed as the M5's, there wasn't a hint of reluctance in its transient responses. The CTS-V was also perfectly happy to provide the driver with as much oversteer as he wanted. The breakaway might be a little more abrupt, but once rotation set in, it was easy enough to control with a judicious throttle foot.""As we all know, the CTS-V edged out the M5 in lap times despite the driver admittingly short-shifting due to a faulty oil pressure sensor on the CTS-V.

He brought the car for a check last monday.That was the first time I floored it so fast and it was fast and scary cuz I didnt know how it would react but it turned out fine. Other car may react differently just be very careful but not mine. It could be true what chris said bcuz of the enormous power.I dont see much TL in chicago, 2 or 3 the most since Jan 04, maybe in other part of the country.

The E60, Sport Package or otherwise, comes equipped with ""Run-Flat"" tires, while mine is equipped with good old fashioned performance tires that will go flat if punctured.  So, what's my point?  So far anyway, everything that I have read regarding the handling and braking capabilities of the new Run-Flat tires has been less that complementary.

It is about the total package.  That includes performance, maintenance, ownership costs, reliability, fun factor, etc.  A car is about how the parts work together as a whole not how the parts are looked at individually.For 0-60 mph fans, read the fine print in each source for how they do their test.  The mags use different methods.  And keep in mind that some magazines adjust the times for temperature and other conditions while other publications publish the actual realized figure.  [I much prefer the uncorrected numbers.]I much prefer C&D's 5-60 mph street start number.  A much more realistic number for the vast majority of drivers.

Uh-huh, right. I suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar cars with smaller engines, and I suppose to their way of thinking, it is. To my way of thinking, that's the easy part, and that it's the rest of the package that makes the ""Upgraded"" car truly superior. Would a CTS-V for instance, have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation? Unknown, but I suspect that the CTS-V is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias, and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver.""Let me setup a scenario: You go to the track to race somebody in a CTS-V, or even - say - a Pontiac GTO.  After they smoke you, you get out - fuming mad - and shout: ""Well, my car has more horsepower per liter!  That's all that counts.  That's what makes my engine superior.  They cheated!  They have more displacement"".Sound absurd to you?  Well, that's what your argument amounts to.  This is a miserable debate - born out of lies and advertising propaganda - that repeats itself each hour of the day all over car forums on the internet, by people who overpaid for imports (with engines that the dealers said is superior to anything made in America) and then end up getting owned by folks driving cars with ""old-tech"" OHV engines.A couple of clowns who write for auto publications have decreed that it's better to produce additional power by revving at higher RPM's than it is by increasing displacement.  Why?  Because they said so.  Because they have English degrees (and no science training) from 3rd rate universities to back it up.  That's why.  And anyone who challenges this orthodoxy is labelled a luddite.I suppose for you old dudes, it's kind of like Vietnam.  ""They lied to us man, they lied to us!!!"" =]Now the 2004 BMW 530 isn't a bad car, but it is overpriced.  And it looks like a Honda from the rear.  And if you think it's any performance match for the CTS-V, then I'm afraid you smoked too much of that green stuff back in the jungles of 'Nam.First of all, I'd like to point out that the Euros would make more high displacement engines if they could.  ""There's no replacement for displacement"".  In their home markets, they have moronic laws that tax based on engine displacement.  That's why they shift development dollars to those high revving buzzboxes.  When displacment is limited, and you're making a 6 or 8 cyllinder engine, you'll get more power out of DOHC, even though OHV has a higher power density (which I will explain in a minute).Second, displacement tells you NOTHING about an engines actual size.  Repeat after me kiddies: displacement tells you NOTHING about an engines actual size.  GM's LS6, for example, is smaller than Nissan's 3.5L VQ (a V6 engine).  OHV engines have more compact packaging than DOHC's.  That's why the LS6 has such high power density, unmatched by anything that BMW has got.Third, the LS6 also produces power in a more fuel efficient manner than BMW's M5 and M3 engines.  It's smaller, more fuel efficient, and more powerful.  I fail to see what - if any - the redeeming aspects of BMW's M engines are.  And keep in mind, I'm talking about the M engines.  Your 530 engine isn't even in this league.Finally, I don't know where you got the impression that your 530 can outhandle a CTS-V.  The CTS-V smoked the BMW M5 and M3 on the Nurburgring.  It's fast in 0-60, and it's no slouch in 60-0 thanks to the 14 inch Brembos.  For that matter, I doubt your 530 could keep up with the plain old 3.6L 255HP CTS that sells well equipped for ~$35,000."

Not to mention, the CTS has a difficult time handling the 400 hp produced by its 5.7L V-8. The S4, on the other hand, seems to handle the added power of its 4.2L V-8 with grace and precision. There&#146;s no vibration from the steering wheel or shifter, and the sound from the exhaust is not overwhelming. All in all, Audi has managed to provide the power and refinement of an engine normally found in big-ticket cars in a refined and much more affordable package, proving it does take more than slapping a big engine in a small car to make our list."" -- WardsAuto.com [Top 10 Best Engines]"

1245,"March 15, 2004  9:33PM",chavis10,"They (Wards) seemed very biased toward the S4.  I wouldn't really classify a 4.2L V-8 as a ""big"" engine. When Benz puts the 5.4L V-8 into the C class(C55 AMG), you can call that a big engine. Plus, they seemed to omit the fact that the S4 is AWD and produces only 302 lbs-ft as opposed to 390 in the CTS-V. I don't get why people still bring up the hp/l arguement.  Who cares how much the enigne displaces as long as it's producing acceptable power and torque while delivering resonable fuel economy.  MB's naturally aspirated AMG V-8 is only putting out about 350 hp out of 5.4L and I never heard a complaint.  Torque is what some people crave. Some people like high revs. That doesn't make either approach better or worse."

Yes I speak from experience, my friend has an S4.  Wonderful car, rides on rails, but you really feel the road.  They're different flavors of the same car.  If you want the most extreme grip and acceleration you go Audi.  If you're willing to sacrifice a tenth or two to gain some comfort and economy you go Caddy.  I seriously doubt that anyone will cross shop the next M5 with these two beauties, there's just too much of a price gap.  Law of diminishing returns anyone?  ;-)Brian"

That is far different than the G35's use of low end plastics. And as the STI is comparable in every performance catagory to sports cars costing far more I would say yes it is a sports car. Good luck finding an is300 or 3 series that can compete with it. Performance is an aspect of luxury but does not make a car a luxury car.

Then onto the IS300, G35, TL, X-type 3.0, 330i, etc.  Hard to say where it ends.  But always thought $40,000 was into the next category.Subaru just doesn't seem to pass the marque bar.  Certain marques almost automatically qualify:  Acura, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Jaguar, Lexus, Lincoln, MB, Saab, and Volvo.  But VW is clearly moving into this market.

I'm just illustrating the point the more companies are going to continue to succesfully low ball BMW and MB with equally equipped and performing cars for thousands less.

WHat else can the Evo/Sti do but go fast? ""Cramming 400 horses down its throat, just isn't going to cut it.""That's another interesting post. People on here are talking about the Sti and Evo being near luxury cars and others are saying the CVT-S isn't going to cut it when a comparably equipped 530i or E320 with 225 and 221 hp respecively can cost more than the V. Well, if the V won't cut it, what will?  You get 400hp, standard everything except sunroof, and a usuable rear seat and trunk all for under $51k.  Meanwhile, 6 cyl BMW 3s and MB Cs can touch $44+ without a problem.  A define near luxury cars as those who's prices start around $30k and provide somewhat uplevel features and safety equipement not found or not standard on cheaper midsized cars.  There are a few cars that bend the rule such as the Maxima or Avalon.  They can be had stripped or equipped with almost every two in the book.  A WRX or Evo are not near luxury cars by any strech of the imagination.  However, hear's the real question, how can cars like the 3 series and C class be near luxury when people can barely fit in the back seat?  I would just have a problems plunking down $40k if I couldn't fit in the back or get a weekends worth of suitcases in the trunk."

To me, yes, to others yes, to some, no?  Would I want one?  Hell no, not at 34, with three kids.

Some tilt more to performance (IS, 3/5 series), some more to luxury (ES, G35) and some are a perfect blend of the two...my TL (ducking now as those German fans throw stuff at me).No way that the STi is a sports sedan.

They're all from manufacturers that are purely pedestrian.Acura's often noted as a tweener company as things like the RSX on the low end keep the high end from being taken seriously.Go into Nordstrom and you see button downs for $15 like at Mervyn's then you're dragging down the brand.  And when buying near luxury, you are buying into a brand image - which is entirely perceived.  Subaru builds a fast car on a cheap platform.  It's a fast, cheap car that has prices which edge toward 30k.  The same can be said of say Dodge with its 300m.  It's still in the same exact brand as the 14k Neon."

These are cars from luxury brands that are used to suck in buyers.  Get them into the luxury fold with low prices and attempt to move them upmarket when they trade out in 3-5 years. It's a luxury brand selling first the brand and then the amenities - some upmarket bits - but for the most part it's about getting buyers to associate good things with a brand.  They want buyers to identify with the brand and hope the buyers are looking to graduate up.The Accord is at the top of the Honda food chain.

A 3 series, while fun, still suffers in many eyes from the fact it's a compact sedan.  You own a C or a 3 and it's usually not a big deal.

Lexus IS was released with one goal: lower the average age of Lexus buyers.  They want to hook them into the brand at 20, so at 35 the LS is a reasonable jump.jrock, you mentioned the Phaeton.  The sales of the Phaeton (304 in the USA for January and February COMBINED) would lead one to conclude the general buying public doesn't accept the idea of a luxury VW.  It's the company that makes the bug and still does to this day!  A 17k bug parked next to a 50k+ Phaeton?  Talk about a blunder by VW."

For instance, the Acura TSX is, technically, Acura's entry level sedan, not the TL.  The Volvo S40 would be the entry, not the S60.  And the 1-series bimmers would be in the same boat when and if they arrive. Yet we can't logically step up to the A6 and E-class just because we include the 2nd tier from the other brands.  So where does that leave us?We could limit it to certain manufacturers, but I fear this also presents a problem.  I think Subaru, for instance, may compete very well with the new Legacy if they chose to load it up with goodies.  Is it fair to exclude them just because they can't afford to start up a whole new rebadged brand to accomodate their vehicles with luxo ammenities?Maybe its a more complex answer.  Like, if the brand has an upscale counterpart, then the base brand is excluded.  So Audi, but no VW; Acura, but no Honda; Infinity, but no Nissan; etc.  However, if said brand has no upscale counterpart (i.e., Subaru, Saab, MB, BMW, Volvo, etc.), then it can be considered on its own merits.  Of course, that still leaves us with the problem of someone complaining the STi should be included although it doesn't even offer a stereo.  So we still need to figure what is required at a minimum to make it a car with luxo aspirations.  Maybe available navigation and power leather seats?  Can anyone think of something that falls outside those requirements that would be included or excluded here unfairly?"

If you can afford a hand-built luxury car but don't need to go around with a three-pointed star or a leaping cat or a flying lady hood ornament to proclaim your arrival, then you may find that this new $64,600 VW more than meets your needs.We use the word ""more"" because the Phaeton offers a luxury car with a 12-cylinder engine for about the price of a V8-powered Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Phaeton comes standard with features such as a navigation system for about what you'd pay for a basic short-wheelbase 7 Series BMW.Volkswagen is moving upscale and the Phaeton is its new luxury sedan, the flagship of a fleet that in the North American market includes the Golf, New Beetle, Jetta, Eurovan, Passat, and the new Touareg sport-utility. In 2006 we should see a modern interpretation of the hippies' favorite, the VW Microbus, followed, perhaps, by a new, mid-engine, two-seat sports car. The expansion of the Volkswagen brand is part of an effort to widen the scope of the entire VW Group, an automotive empire that includes VW, Audi, SEAT, Skoda, Lamborghini, Bugatti and Bentley. In 1999, the Volkswagen Group ranked sixth in worldwide sales, but subsequently has overtaken Renault/Nissan and DaimlerChrysler and trails only General Motors, Ford and Toyota.The term phaeton dates back to days of horse-drawn carriages, and then was applied for special, coach-built touring cars with custom features. In the case of the Volkswagen Phaeton, most of those custom features are included as standard equipment."" -- Larry Edsall, automotive.com"
1288,"March 17, 2004  5:00PM",jjabbytaylor,"I remember a few years back when I first remember hearing this term ""near-luxury"" car.  At the time, most of them were rebadged Camrys (ES300), Nissans (I30), etc.  Thus, many people considered them to basically be fancier Camrys et. al., with higher stickers.  These cars didn't differ much from their platform-mates and were lacking many of the luxury features of the ""true"" luxury cars.It seems to me like the term may be a bit more problematic now.  Yes, the ES330 is still built on the Camry platform and the I35 is still based on the Maxima.  However, they look a lot different than the base cars now, and have quite a few more luxury features than before.In addition, the lower-end luxury models are now featuring extremely nice interiors, many luxury features, etc.  Even though my '04 TL is considered near-luxury, the interior still feels every bit as nice to me as my old '93 BMW 525i did, if not more so.  Now, I'm not going to throw a grenade in the tent by trying to compare the handling of the two cars Maybe entry-level luxury is a better term for these cars now...Jeff"
1289,"March 17, 2004  6:07PM",blueguydotcom,"Yeah, a very select group are willing to pay 60k for a VW.  Boy those trailblazers.  This isn't like Toyota creating Lexus and the groundbreaking 35k LS400.  Toyota had a great reputation - something VW doesn't have.  Toyota created a luxury brand from scratch and populated it with a vehicle that mirrored the big boy on the block - MB but for less money.  VW's Phaeton mirrors...the Passat.  Oh, there's a marketing coup!  Lets nail down the logic.  We've got a company well known for mechanical and electrical problems offering a high priced luxo-cruiser under the same banner as 16k economy cars and the new car most closely resembles a 23-40k mid-size sedan.  That's just brilliant.Gosh, I sure hope Ford comes out with a plus-sized version of the Taurus and sells it for 50k.  That'd be keen. Branding.  That's what it's all about in the luxury arena.  Ask MB about the Maybach."
1290,"March 17, 2004  8:55PM",sapparo,"The Phaeton will be a bigger and much costlier bust than the W8 Passat which went nowhere in sales. And that was a $38-40K car. Yeah VW quality is in the toilet literally. VW execs. should take a good hard look from Japan, you gotta have a solid foundation before you reach for the glam and glitz. Why not promote the A8 more which never was a big seller instead of handicaping it with a near twin. Real smart eh!

Most reviews I've read have been pretty positive, but they all question whether buyers will be willing to forgo the snob appeal to obtain a better value in their luxury cars.The Phaeton is a pretty nice looking car (IMHO) and in some ways it might be nice to have a car that doesn't scream ""I have lots of money"".As far as quality goes, the BMW 7-Series and Mercedes S-Class have been having some quality problems of their own lately. Jeff"
1292,"March 17, 2004 10:42PM",pat,"Now really, the Phaeton and the 7-Series and the S-Class are not anywhere close to the ""near"" or entry-level"" lux category.  How about if we just say $32k to $42k as a minimum requirement for eligibility in this discussion?  That would at least keep us within some workable range.I want to change ""Near"" to Entry-Level"" in the title.  How about if I also drop performance?  I think that should make unnecessary some of the carryings-on about what belongs here and what doesn't.Let me hear what you have to say and I'll make up my mind tomorrow."

Dropping ""performance"" from the moniker should only add the ES330 (among the imports) to the discussion, as that car is the only car that is decidely ""non-performance"" in this price cateogry.I read the G35x Follow-Up Test on Edmunds, and I pretty much agree with what the writer said.  The design of the interior is fine (except I'm not a big fan of the orange lights) and I actually feel that the quality of the leather seats is better than the seats in the TL or the 3 series.  Hopefully, they'll really lick the dash material quality issues in the 2005 model."
1295,"March 18, 2004  1:00AM",qbrozen,"is that 32k to 42k with or without options?  either way?  i guess it would have to be, wouldn't it?  and i assume we are talking MSRP numbers, right?  I feel its a given, but you just know someone will be over here saying ""but this guy says he knows a guy who read somewhere that this other guy bought a CTSV for $42K.""  so we'll probably want to put a stop to that now and specify its MSRP numbers."
1296,"March 18, 2004  1:47AM",fedlawman,"Why can't we just accept that everyone has a different opinion of where the near luxury line is drawn.For example, Riez stated that he thinks the IS300 is higher on the food chain than the 325i, probably because it has a larger, more powerful engine (and he owns a couple of them). I however, consider the 325i higher on the food chain than the IS300 because it's just as quick, but more refined and mature, in my opinion.Price doesn't work either because of my admittedly biased opinion that the TSX belongs in the same league as the 325i and IS300 because it offers similar performance and luxury, but only costs $26,000.And then there's the Mazda 6s and V-6 Accord, which offer performance and luxury on par with many of the cars here, yet they simply lack breeding (brand identification).For a car to be a true ""near-luxury"" performance sedan, I believe it must possess some combination of all of these traits, in varying degrees.Maybe a formula could be devised assigning points for luxury brand name, overall performance, quality interior/cockpit, exterior elegance, overall driving refinement."
1297,"March 18, 2004  1:11PM",qbrozen,"last night i was thinking that, specifically, the TSX would present a problem as a car that falls outside of the price requirements but that many folks would feel belongs here.I don't feel the Mazda competes here just on merit of being slow in a straight line.  It is also lacking quite a bit in the luxury department on merit of lacking sound deadening and something I feel should be available on a car that wants to be considered ""luxury"": navigation.  So, to me, the Mazda belongs here no more than the STi does.I think the Accord is too closely tied to the TL.  If the Accord is permitted, then you open the doors to the Maxima and Camry.  And then you might as well include the Kia Amanti, Hyundai XG350, Chrysler 300, etc, etc."
1298,"March 18, 2004  1:19PM",riez,"fedlawman...  My initial ranking was based on price and layout.  The inexpensive FWD/4-cyl cars like TSX and 9-3 at ""bottom"".  A stripped 325i is less expensive than an IS300, has less standard equipment, and a smaller engine.  Plus the 330i is certainly ""higher"" up than the 325i.  Thus the more expensive, higher performing 330i is ""higher"" up than the IS300."

InfinitiLincolnSaabSubaruVolkswagenVolvo No way in hades is Subaru near anything luxury.  Subaru makes economy and joe blow cars.  If you sell a car for under 20k there's no way any vehicle from the brand can be considered luxury.

It may be the most expensive car in that brand but the brand itself is common place.An entry-level lux car is the bottom rung of the luxury brand's offerings.

Subaru's are fairly highly regarded, if they weren't why do you see all the AWD and Sportwagons out these days. I will agree that adding it to the Premium segment is touchy, but thats only because of the prior level of interior refinement and powertrain options. The chassis/platforms and worldwide engine drivetrains are considered top notch. The US is finally geting the nicer equipment, plus nicer vehicles are in the works.

1333,"March 19, 2004  2:42AM",knr5,"In the interests of keeping things simple, I suggest, Pat, that you lose the ""maybes"" from your list and add Saab 9-3 and 9-5.  I agree with jrock65 that Saabs are perceived as being more upscale than the Nissans, Toyotas, Hondas etc., more or less in the same bracket as Volvos.There is some truth to every perspective on the issue of what cars belong in this discussion.  Cars use combination brands -- the make and the individual model name -- to, perhaps, benefit from both family branding and individual branding.  So, while there is some halo effect from the make, the dominant perception is one based on the individual model.  People may swear by the ""Pathfinder"" while detesting the ""Xterra"", for example.  A person driving around in a ""Land Cruiser"" is looked upon very differently than one tooling around in a ""Corolla.""  So, in my view, it is more meaningful to discuss specific models as being in the upscale performance sedan category.  In some (hopefully, rare) cases, therefore, cars from so-called ""lesser"" makes may deserve to be discussed in this forum as well.There are as many ""best buys"" as there are people.  It is, after all, a function of priorities driven by individual and/or family needs and wants.  Every car is a compromise among competing demands, just as every purchase decision is.  A lot of the firepower in these forums, while highly entertaining, is often misdirected.  A lot of the criticism of different cars (and, occasionally, their owners!) is analogous to faulting the lion for not having the grace of a gazelle!:)Just my 2c!:)Raj"

1336,"March 19, 2004  7:31AM",blueguydotcom,I did not know you care much about what other people think about your car.I do care because since I've purchased a BMW I've found I'm treated quite differently when people connect me with the car.  For the most part the experiences have been quite negative but the fact remains in my Protege I'm anonymous.  Not so in my other car.I buy cars because I like it not because others think it's prestigious or not.I never wrote you or I did otherwise.  But when you read the reasons most people buy cars it's rarely related to how the car drives - reputation for dependability and resale is what drives honda and toyota in such a big way.

She thought it was nice if underpowered.  I have two friends who were raised on Saabs and there seems to be some kind of genetic code that passes from parent to child to get the kid into Saabs.

It will sell for around $34k very well equipped.  I own a 2000 300M with 70k on the dial and it still rides as good as the day I got it.

I can see the arguement for calling it a ""tweener"" brand, but it is a brand really shopped by people also looking and can afford Acuras, Audi's, BMW's, and Volvos. I hope Pat will add them to the list.    As for Subaru, I will give up the ghost. Although I think it deserves a consideration, maybe not yet until the updated models come out and prove something.  But note  Subaru is also cross shopped with Acura, Audi, Audi, BMW and Volvo for sure. Note also, all the brands mentioned in this topic have reacted to what Subaru has done, so the other brand managers know whats up. I wont argue AWD vs RWD, it's a preference. But AWD provides awesome driving dynamics for a multitude of surfaes and conditions. The Chrysler 300M deserves consideration, not for the brand but the car itself."

If you want to talk about them, talk about how they do or do not fit the ""performance"" description along with anything else of interest.I am ruling out all other suggestions, though, for the reasons stated earlier.  Those reasons include the fact that we should keep this to a marque that intends to convey luxury across its spectrum, it is nonsensical to have a never-ending discussion about what the discussion is about and most importantly, it's time to draw the line.So here it is - talk about the cars in my list or go make another discussion if you need to talk about something else.  Just keep in mind that another vague, undefined category doesn't serve any purpose.  To keep it useful, interesting and productive, be sure to clearly define the topic.Okay?  Have at it!!:-)"

If I cared not about the precision feel of a BMW and slickness of the looks and just needed a car.. I will admit if those were the only 14 cars in the universe, it would be the Acura TL."

1356,"March 20, 2004 11:16AM",cybersol,"I find it quite amusing that for 5 pages or so the discussion focused on what the discussion was about. Reminds me so much of meetings meant to talk about other meetings.I think Pat's list is a good one. One addition in both my opinion and from magazines that compare vehicle in this class would be the Lincoln LS. First of all, Lincoln is obviously meant to be Ford's luxury brand. Secondly, the LS costs between 30-42k in most configurations. Third the car itself definitely has both luxury and performance intentions. By all owner accounts, it performs and handles well, even if I personally would not be interested in a Ford product at this time, so that I have not driven one.Back to talking about cars... If I were shopping today, taking into account that my priorities are size, performance, price, reliability, and then luxury... these SEDANS would be on my shopping list in this order:1) Infiniti G352) Acura TL3) BMW 330i4) everything elseEnjoy, cybersol"
1357,"March 20, 2004  7:09PM",qbrozen,"I said it before, and I'll say it again, i really think this needs to be added.according to C&D, 0-60 in 6.5 and:In most track trials, the Lincoln set stellar marks. Although it was wearing all-weather tires, usually thought to be a disadvantage, it outran all but the Benz on the skidpad and topped all in the lane-change test. Very shrewd choices were made in the chassis tuning of this car.And since the Sport V8 comes in at $40,500 with delivery, the only fault I see with it is the lack of a manual tranny.  But I don't see that as a reason to exclude it because some folks prefer an auto and some even require it."

1363,"March 21, 2004  5:05AM",scott1,"I went through all of the comparisons of the cars on this list in January while I was trying to decide which car to order. I ended up ordering a CTS with the luxury/sport package and the dvd navigation system. (blue chip exterior, light gray/ebony interior).I drove the BMW 3 series and liked its driving characteristics, but didn't care for its styling or interior room. The same can be said for the Mercedes C class..I drove a V6 version and while it was a solid quiet riding car, it didn't have the interior space I was looking for.I very seriously considered the Lexus ES 330, but ultimately decided that while it rode very smooth and quietly, the handling just wasn't there. The fact that it basically looked like a Camry didn't help either.  I had a bad prior ownership experience with a Honda, so did not consider the acura.  The CTS seemed to have exactly what I was looking for. A quiet comfortable ride combined with excellent handling, plenty of interior  space in both the back and front seats, and a very refined smooth and powerful engine. The real bonus for me is the styling of the exterior though...the CTS is one fine looking car from any angle, and doesn't look like just another box on wheels.I checked with my dealer today and he expects my car to be delivered within the next week or so. I'm looking forward to that."

Perfect weather, beautiful cars, and a terrific experience.My FWD 4-banger kept up just fine with all those E46 325's. I lapped more than a few inexperienced drivers piloting E46 330's, and even paced a well driven E36 M3 for one complete lap...what a blast! Then I got a 4 lap ride in a '96 Porsche 911 Turbo. Wow!What else...two 350Z's were out on the track - they sound awesome (nice throaty exhaust) accelerating down the straight-away and through turn 1. Also, one guy had a late model Lotus Esprit, and there were two WRX STi's out there. One of the STi's was in my group and got behind me, seemingly out of nowhere. I waved him past me after exiting turn 9 and he passed me like I was standing still (I was doing about 60)!Overall, a terrific club and an awesome day of fun at Pacific Raceways!"

He finally caught up to me, so I did it to him again (6th to 4th). He never did pass me and I'm sure I ruined his day. I won't say how fast I was going but the TL surprised even me."

In fact, it's a one sided affair."

It was also interesting to note how evenly matched all of the cars in this competition are, even though there is a combination of FWD and RWD, and ""luxury"" (BMW 325i) vs. ""economy"" (Nissan Sentra).Which begs the question - if RWD vs. FWD doesn't matter at Sebring, why do so many ""enthusiasts"" think it makes a difference on I-90?"

IS there a special dyno for this is or did the TL owner do some funky math to get from the wheels to the crank?  My guess is the math involved to make the 282 leap is rather fuzzy at best.  The TL is one great value if you can stomach the wheel jerking from your hand once in a while but it is not STI beater. If the STI was between 4500 and 7000 the whole time you would have seen nothing but fumes.  The power band of the TL is quite evident in the 50-120 stats and 0-100.. I suggest you take a look at the STI stats for those metrics before you get too enthusiastic about the less than torque ridden 3.2.""Which begs the question - if RWD vs. FWD doesn't matter at Sebring, why do so many ""enthusiasts"" think it makes a difference on I-90? "" This explains much - I suggest anyone questioning RWD in context of freeway driving actually drive a decent RWD car on some back roads.  IF someone thinks they are going to enjoy - let alone accept the seemingly foreign concept of throttle induced overteer on the highway, I imagine they will be out of the genepool soon enough.  The oversteer I paid 35k for is never enjoyed on a highway - it's enjoyed on the hairpins of an open field with a two lane country road with 10 foot tall cows and fog smoked expanses and no one in sight....and carefully pressing the throttle just enough, with just enough feedback to push the weight back to the rear wheels just as that very power causes them, with buttery smooth finesse, to slide into the perfect exit angle AND keep traction where wide open throttle can push your back into the leather.

1386,"March 22, 2004  8:11PM",chrisboth,Yes my soon to be mother in law has one.  I'd rather have a v-6 passat 5sp.  it's quiet and fairly nice interior but very low on the mercedes quality scale and not to big not to mention the fact it just looks like a baby S class.  It's ok but - so is the 28k passat for that matter.  The engine isn't bad but it doenn't beg to be pushed like a G that for shore.
1387,"March 22, 2004  9:39PM",dhanley,"I drove one at the GM autoshow-on-the-road.  They had a loopy test track, and a lot of cars to take out on it.  The c320 really handled better than i expected and was very refined.  It had a bit more non-melodious engine noise than i expected; i was surprised by that.  It was nice, but it was also a 45K car.  The CTS was there too.  It was nice, but a bit too isolated for me.  I like quiet, but i want to feel the road and hear the engine rev.  Somehow, the interior just seemed to whisper chevrolet.  It seemed spacious inside, which probably appeals to other more than it does to me.  But if you like the interior and isolation, this is probably a really good car.  Drove the 9-5 aero, that was probably my favorite, i really like the looks, interior, the actual out the door price ( they have $6000 in rebates on it now and sell at invoice(??) ) and i love the engine.  But it didn't handle as well as the cts or the c320.  The 9-3 was there but it was the base 9-3 linear and didn't impress, mostly due to the interior.  The engine needed more power, but the handling was really quite good. it tracked well and had good feedback.  I recently sat in a 9-3 convertable at the autoshow later and thought that the interior in it was really nice, so maybe it's improved.  Also saw the s40 at the autoshow, and the interior really looked cheap to me, and there were several broken parts inside, which i guess could have been due to it's being a prototype and suffering autoshow abuse.  But based on the numbers this is a really good car, so i would look at it again.  I drove an x-type 3.0.  The car looks really good, i thought, and the interior is very attractive, but again there were 3 demos at the dealer and 2 had broken parts inside ( one had the cell phone  cover broken by the dealership owner ).  All the driving controls felt too light to me, and the engine despite its increased HP felt weak at low RPM's--i didn't feel that i could pass on the highway without dropping out of fifth, but i thought it sounded great when i revved it up.  I didn't feel that i got a lot of steering feedback but it was also impressively quiet on the highway.  The door sill was really high and the back doors only opened 45 degrees so it was hard for me to get in the back.  I drove a new 325i and it's good, but i couldn't help but feel that it's been somewhat lexiified.  The shifter had vaguer detents and the engine noise and steering effort were dialed down.  I might have liked it a lot more if it had the sport package.  I don't like the newer bmw designs, and i look askance at the increasing complexity of these cars.I drove a g35, too,  it certainly had a lot of power, and had pretty good feedback.  I was mostly turned off by the interior which i felt was pretty cheap and the amount of tire noise that got into the interior ( too much for my tastes ).  Also, my friend who has one reports really poor MPG.  Oh, test drove the is300 as well.  I thought it looked  ( WARNING: personal taste issue ) tacky inside, and was too consistently noisy due to road noise.  Also, the interior didn't fit my frame very well.  I thought several cars felt better handling around town.  Drove a last-gen a4 1.8T.  Overall thought it felt very composed and had a nice interior, but it definitely needed more engine.  Also, a friend with a passat has had a dismal reliability experience.  But if i was leasing it from a subservient dealer i would probably feel ok about it.  The sporty acuras i've been in (cl-s, integra,RSX) i've had a hard time getting comfortable in, so i haven't even bothered to test drive them.  I haven't looked at the new tl-s.  There was nothing that made me feel that i need to go out and trade my 328i, but i want to test a 9-3 arc if i happen to be near a dealer with some free time.  I almost hope i hate it so i don't feel the urge to waste money on a car swap.  dave"
1388,"March 22, 2004 10:24PM",buddhabman,"Sounds like the C320 drives pretty nice, albeit $$$$$ That's great that you have had the chance for so many drives. I have an Aero wagon, and as much as I like the car, it does need some stiffer springs and stiffer rear sway bar to help the handles. It tracks well but rough stuff in the canyons makes it hit the bump stops and there is more roll. Great brakes, and isn't it fast, 0-60 is alright but I tell you people 60-120 in an Aero is something else. I wish they would bump up the power in the 9-5 Aero.  All the Saab tuners have EMP's to take it to 280-300HP.   I think the 9-3 Aero is a sweet looking car. If they bumped it to 250/250 it would be killer."
1389,"March 23, 2004 12:10AM",dhanley,"Agree.  The c320 was nice but seemed expensive to me for what it was--solid, quiet, ok handling but not really extraordinary, while having no glaring flaws.  I guess i didn't realize the price of the CTS i drove.  I want to the caddy website and i see that was probably a $43K car ( 3.6L, xenons, upgraded sterio, sunroof ).  But i suppose there will be many thousands off at some point.  The 9-5 was as you describe--swayed more than i liked, and understeer was very easy to provoke; I didn't feel secure pushing it in turns.  It's acceleration was so-so 0-30 then after that, really impressive.  To be blunt, i thought it was a very well-thought out car suffering from an old chassis; it could have used more suspension travel and structural ridgidity.   I expect the 9-3 areo will be 250hp beofre long, the upcoming 9-3 hatch is supposed to get 250hp out of the same motor with direct injection.  You can already get a chip for that HP level, but i shy away from mods and prefer to get the power stock."

Once you get there you can block the folks behind you at the point where they may have a handling advantage. As long as you can cary enough exit speed to win the race between corners and have the brakes to stay there, you can make it really hard for somebody to pass you cleanly. Track configuration can also favor one car  over another. To really make a FWD race car work you have to have some lift throttle oversteer. We used to trail brake and run more air pressure in the rear tires to get more oversteer. Once you get back on the gas the car pushes hard. So you take an earlier apex than a RWD car, induce some oversteer via lift throttle and/or trail braking, then stand on the gas and let the car understeer out from the apex of the corner. With some practice and the right balance it can be a lot of fun if you don't overheat the front tires or brakes during the race."

The four-wheel drive R will have the latest version of Jaguar's V6 engine, using some form of forced induction to give it 330 bhp and 330 lb. ft of torque. There has been some whispers that the engine might not follow the usual supercharged R formula, for it could well be turbocharged instead, due to a lack of space under the compact saloons bonnet. The 3.0-litre engine could also be expanded to 3.2 litres and 250bhp, an upgrade likely to debut in the whole X-Type range.  0-60 acceleration is said to be around the five-second mark, and top speed nudging 165 mph. Jaguar's new six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission will be standard, though no news on a Tiptronic/SMG style box - Jaguar preferring the J-Gate. The R will stand out with it's enlarged bumpers, huge exhaust pipes, mesh front grille, de-chromed exterior and 19-inch alloy wheels, but no silly body kit or boot spoilers. Unlike the other R's, it will not have any additional air intakes on its bonnet.

What you're describing is no more exciting than doing burnouts at streetlights""This is making me weary - don't take it from me - take it from thousands of publications and books such as solo racing instuctional manuals or guides that the PERFECT turn in a RWD car involves slight and intended rear wheel slide (just a touch now - its not a burnout smokeout like some who have never driven a RWD hard  suggest).  The point at which your front wheels have pushed the car to another angle while the rear wheels are driven with throttle input to the former angle there will and is a correction at higher speed. That induced oversteer which is limited to exactly the right amount becasue the weight transfers to the rear (where the driven wheels are) and traction is regained (this takes timing).  Anyone who drives a FWD and preaches that this beautiful method of driving is like teen fun in a parking lot should get a refund and drive a bike.  I have suggested that on the track a FWD can have it's place and setups and drivers can compensate for anything with non-street suspsensions.  Who gives a crud about the track this is about what my family sedan can do in a turn that some never may understand.  I could care less whose faster I dont even race or go to the track.  I want tourque and throttle induced oversteer corrections in the most perfectly balanced car maybe ever made.HERE IS THE CRUX OF YOUR ARGUMENT:  TRACTION LOSS IS BAD.  wrong - heres whyRWDers understand that this correction is intended because the momentum loss in the turn is WAY LESS if the rear wheels simply slide a bit as opposed to entering the turn at a lower speed and not having any traction lost.  When this slide is complete the car actually gets the traction started again from the throttle pushing the weight back in a perfectly balanced and timed and HEAVENLY turn without ANY momentum lost.  It's like a airforce guy telling a navy skipper how to drive a ship.  This very argument contains the reasons why IMO its worth all the money i put into the G every month.

But there still is some.pg48477...  Do your own test.  Take a powerful front driver out for a spin.  Make a couple of quick standing starts.  Akin to 0-60 mph test.  First, take your hands OFF the steering wheel.  The accelerate hard.  See where the car goes.  Watch what is happening to the steering wheel.  Next do it with your hands very lightly on the wheel.  Finally with your hands very firmly on the wheel.  The tugging of the steering wheel indicates torque steer by the wheels which do double duty in regards to both steering and powering at same time.Most pronounced in cars with more power-delivery efficient manual transmissions.  ATs ""sap"" some power to the wheels.  One of the best practical articles on this subject is C&D's comparison a few years ago of the RWD 330Ci to the FWD CL Type-S 6-speed manual.  Their CL had the then new LSD which made a huge world of improvement.Well designed powerful FWDer will use LSD and equal length half shafts to minimize torque steer."

There are huge areas for some people to make mistakes and make bad judgements and for one to assume they know that all RWD cars have to be unsafe and will be at the edge of that grey area is absurd.  OR a weak attempt to mask the fact that you never have experienced what keeps entire companies from going the way of honda (FWD) despite it's popularity stemming from cost manufacturing effeciency and cost reductions.

I do understand the delicate line that you are talking about and how you induce this with judicious application of throttle to rotate the car (I have owned a Miata for 10 years and still enjoy this).What I'm trying to tell you is that this effect is not exclusive to RWD platforms. Although a well balanced FWD car can be made to ""oversteer"" with lift-throttle, you can also ""rotate"" the rear end of a FWD car with a gentle application of power. To see (feel) this in action, run a FWD car through a slalom course. When you gently press the gas and feel the rear end ""tuck in"" and rotate around the cone, you'll know what I'm talking about.It's different than a RWD'er, and not exactly the same as ""riding the threshold"" like your talking about, but it is no less entertaining or effective. I think that RWD loyalists tend to get caught in a ""Rear-drive paradigm"" sometimes because it's simply the way it's always been, and the way most of us learned to drive way back when. Yes, I love driving the Miata to experience tha ""classic"" dynamics of a RWD sports car but, driving my FWD TSX is no less challenging or entertaining. If you've never explored the limits of a well tuned FWD sports car, then your missing out on something special. Then again, if your satisfied with what you've got and don't care to try something new, then that's fine too.Believe me, I'm not trying to discredit your comments because I do think they are valid. I am simply trying to point out that FWD has no inherent performance limitations compared to RWD. It's just two ways to reach the same result...Vive la difference."

I know all about oversteer in a front driver.  I've spent more time in front than rear wheel in fact.  I'm quite satisfied with what i have now as we all seem to be.  It's not about challenging or entertaining it's about knowing both types of platforms and prefering one over the other.  I would think an RSX is very tossable and way fun.  But to drive it would mean giving up something that is way too important to most serious Sports sedan drivers regardless of our intentions to race or win something..its about physics and working with forces as opposed to against them as FWD put the steering and drivepower at odds.  After 10 years of CRX's and integras and passats that were quite fun to drive, I can't tell you how nice it is to finally (again) not have to drive into a corner concerned that my front wheels wont be able to turn if pushed.  With VDC this may not be a problem but for me the whole issue is the inherint limitations that dont exist in RWD.""What I'm trying to tell you is that this effect is not exclusive to RWD platforms""What is exclusive is the momentum one can have going in and out and the line you use and the way in which one can be certain that a bit of gas before the exit is good for traction in RWD and BAD for FWD.  The throttle app to GAIN traction right as you exit is the money and cant be enjoyed in front drives.  Otherwise we'd all be in friont drives - they are cheaper to build."

The g is a 52F 48R such that when you hit the throttle in the sweet spot of the apex (the entire thrust of this whole argument) the weight shift back to a perfect 50/50.  When a FWD car pushed the gas all the weight goes away from the drive wheels.  RSX can still be fun, but these finely tweaked and enjoyable RWD cars are built for getting around curves a particular way..the same way as ferrari, porsche, bmw, chrysler, dodge, ford, lambo.  Some may be more than i can pay but the infiniti designers spent alot of money to make sure we can do this.  Noone should buy a RWD if they dont want this.

1441,"March 25, 2004  6:33PM",riez,"fedlawman...  Does your TSX have automatic or manual transmission?  What does a TSX weigh with full tank of gas and driver on board?  Somewhere around 3,500 pounds?  You likely don't personally experience any torque steer due to the lack of power, esp. little torque.  Would it even have 170 wheel HP?  How much torque and HP does its small motor produce at 3K, 3.5K, and 4K RPMs?  Even pretty brutal high RPM 0-60 mph launch can't get too much power to the front wheels.  That is where it counts!  You can't expect a small 4-cyl. engine that needs to rev high for best output to compare with the output of the much bigger engines in powerful FWDers like TL, Maxima, Seville, etc. Wonder what the power to weight ratios are for your TSX and the Neon SRT-4.

Great price.  Great standard (HID) and optional equipment (LSD).  Great platform, including RWD, IRS, and manual transmission.  Great overall performance.  Fantastic reliability/quality.  Great warranty (both b-to-b and powertrain with optional mfr extension to b-to-b).  Good ownership costs (though insurance a bit too high).  Great safety, including crash test results.

1469,"March 27, 2004  5:56PM",raher,"Sales figures reflect how any automobile is being received by the consumer. In the long run they determine whether any model continues in production based on the manufacturer's defined return on investment. Sales determine whether a manufacturer makes changes to an existing model to improve sales or whether they decide to introduce a new model.Sales figures certainly do not denote superiority in terms of styling, performance, handling, etc but they do denote what combination of these the consumer prefers. The wholesale increase in HP across most of the models in this discussion is an example. I am amused by the comments I see here insinuating that ""Joe Blow"" buys mediocre cars and some individuals are above that because they buy cars that they have somehow defined as ""different"".  Superiority in the marketplace is what every manufacturer is seeking. That marketplace is however defined differently by different manufacturers. Ferrari does not have the same sales goals as Honda, Nissan, Toyota but they do have some numbers they want to meet in order to maintain their place in whatever market they decide is important to them. You can't discount sales as a very important indicator. The reference to McDonalds is an attempt to deride one of the most globally successful businesses. It doesn't matter if Joe Blow eats there and you don't. Other businesses would kill for McDonald's success in their market. Freedom of choice is a wonderful thing. The marketplace inevitably determines what survives and sales figures are the feedback from the marketplace to the manufacturers. It will also inevitably determine what you get on your new car in the future. Navigation systems weren't on any cars a few years ago.The sales figures for the new TL reflect an acceptance on the part of the consumer that Acura is on the right track with their blend of styling, handling, performance etc.The new Acuras will drive changes to BMW , Nissan , Toyota and others just as they drove the changes to the new TL.. Competition is also a wonderful thing. The consumer wins in the end.Most of the discussion on this board is ""my car is better than your car"" supported by whatever article, personal experience or personal opinion the author chooses to use to attempt to justify their position. No one is right and no one is wrong since none of it can really be objectively substantiated.It is always interesting to hear from the participants here however and many of the opinions are put forth from an obvious informed background. I learn a lot here and also laugh a lot.God bless the internet."

And every manufacturer mentioned thus far, excels in one area or another. Nobody excels at everything. Some people look at the total package, others are more selective and buy for a characteristic or two.That is, why do people get Ferraris and huge SUVs. Based on one or two characteristics (hope I don't have to spell 'em out).

I'm a strong proponent of a ton of cars.  I've owned, and enjoyed, G20, 323i, IS300, LS8, and many more.  I'm not set in my ways nor inherently or permanently partial to any one marque or model."
1478,"March 27, 2004 10:35PM",iwantonetoo,"I'm not suggesting that people who buy a TL are stupid. Personally I think it is a fine car, and my opinion has nothing to do with sales figures. Even if they only sold 1000 of them per month, I would still feel the same way. BMW sells far less M3's per month, so that makes it a lesser car? Not by my way of thinking. ""Does it make sense that a car is very popular and has a big hit in it's sales because of :1. the car doesnt perform well?2. Bad handling3. Cant even handle a corner?""Evidently this is quite true in regards to the Camry and Accord. Hence, I personally base my taste in automobiles on what I like, not on what is the most popular. Again, I am not flaming you or the TL."

(Although I must tell you that I compared the I35 to the 04 TL, and the Infiniti salesman was falling all over himself to spark my interest in an 03! I35 even though 04 I35s were in the showroom.)Now, there is probably something to be said for those cars that have more demand than supply, and something else to be said for those cars that have more supply than demand.  The raw sales totals of any given month for any given model are more or less meaningless, unless you know what business/marketing model the manufacturer has chosen for that model. The fact that BMW could sell more M3s than it chooses to produce and Acura can sell more TLs with Nav than it can produce tells us nothing more than that the market sees both cars favorably.  Now for example, if BMW is not meeting it's 3-series sales goals since the 04 Acura TL was introduced... that's a different story altogether. BTW, I have no idea if that is the case. It's probably more like Infiniti success with the G35 hurting the I35.  Is Honda seeing demand soften for the V-6 Accord since the TL was introduced? That is just a guess - the price points being so disparate would tend to work against that hypothesis from a microeconomic perspective...."

If you take 7 seconds to hit 60, then the car has average power.  What's average?  Falling into the 80-40% percentile which is in my book the same as failing.  If the Altima and Accord can scamper to 60 in under 7, I expect so can a sports sedan.The TL's handling is certainly better than mediocre.Heck it supposedly handles better than a TSX and I thought the TSX was a sharp handling little car.  The C230K engine is not small.The 230 is just not up to snuff, IMHO.

I basically agree with you, with the caveat that if two cars of similar class, price and capabilities are released on the same date, and are produced at the same rate, and have the same advertising budget and company promoting them, then I suppose if one outsells the other by 50%, it is probably statistically significant.

Automobile's huge test (10/03) included cars like IS300 and G35 as well as TSX, WRX, Lancer Evo, Mazda 6 S.  I certainly do think the TSX is a legitimate comparison with 325i, IS300, etc.Think we both like numbers.  Using recent C&D data for IS300 (3/04--7 car comparison test) and TSX (7/03--full road test), both with manual transmissions and tires that are 17 inch and 215mm wide:MSRP as tested: $31, 944 IS300 vs $28,990 TSXWeight:  3,380 lbs vs 3,2460-60 mph: 7.3 secs vs 7.25-60 mph: 7.8 secs vs 7.71/4 mile: 15.7 @ 90 mph vs 15.6 @ 91 mph30-50 mph: 8.6 secs vs 10.250-70 mph: 8.3 secs vs 9.770-0 braking: 167 ft vs 185Lane change: 64.7 mph (best in test) vs no dataskidpad: .88g vs .85Top speed:  139 mph vs 133 The TSX's lighter weight and dragstrip-like 4.70:1 final drive certainly helps acceleration (vs. IS300's 3.73:1).

1493,"March 28, 2004 10:03PM",fedlawman,"Agreed.The TSX is definitely at a disadvantage in top gear acceleration tests due to its gearing (you can really see this effect in the 270 hp TL's top gear figures!).The reason why the TSX was excluded from the recent C&D comparo is because it was a ""$35,000 sedan comparo"" and the TSX is only $26,500. I honestly think (must admit some bias here) the TSX would have scored higher than the TL because of it's overall better balance and lack of handling vices.I hadn't seen the Automobile numbers, but I think they look a little conservative. There's always going to be some variation from test to test but, I've owned several 8 second 0-60 cars over the years, and the TSX isn't one of them."

C&D, RT, MT, etc. do tell readers how they test (e.g., if they use high RPM drop clutch) and whether they adjust for atmospheric conditions.  For example, C&D adjusts; R&T doesn't.C&D:  ""Acceleration:  Test vehicle is loaded with driver, full tank of fuel, and 10 pounds of test instrumentation.  With manual-transmission cars, wheelspin or clutch slip or both are used at the starting line to make best use of the engine's power characteristics and the vehicle's traction.

Actually, the TSX did ""win"" that 7/03 MT comparison test and, even at 7.9 secs, it actually had the ""quickest"" 0-60 mph time of these three cars.Don't get mad, but as I've said before, the TSX's small naturally aspirated 2.4L I4 just doesn't generate a ton of HP (and what it does do it needs high RPMs to do) and generates way less torque (esp. useable torque down low).Has anyone ever seen a published test result for a TSX automatic?  Wonder if it pushes 9 secs. 0-60 mph?"

Seems about right to me.As for the small & lacking power comments, I guess it depends on what you're comparing it too. Of course the 2.4L I-4 has a displacement and power deficit compared to Nissan's 3.5 L VQ motor. What car in this segment doesn't (besides the TL)? But compared to all the rest (Audi 3.0L, BMW 2.5L, Lexus 3.0L, Saab 2.0L, M-B 1.8L, Jaguar 3.0L), it appears that the TSX'S 200 hp stacks up just fine.The recent C&D $35,000 sedan comparo that you mentioned had the 325i as the 3rd fastest car behind the G35 and TL (no surprise there).

Also notice that the Honda I-4 offers 90% of peak torque (166) from 2000 RPM all the way to 7000 RPM...that's a 5000 RPM-wide powerband to play with! How many cars can make that claim?So let me agree with you up to a point. The TSX engine is small and underpowered compared to the G35 and TL.

Oh, the price certainly helped make the TSX more palatable too.   26k (yes it was offered to me at 26k BEFORE I even attempted to haggle) v. a stripped 325i that was still hovering over 30k with discounts."

Two results are close (8.1 and 7.9) with the C&D 7.2 being the exception.  C&D's number is adjusted for conditions so we don't know what the actual track result was.  Doesn't appear R&T has tested a TSX, yet.  Anyone got data from AutoWeek?  Has CR tested one?Seems like the published data would have TSX manual around 8.0.  No idea about automatic, but think it possible it might add up to 1 second (ATs tend to sap smallish low torque I4s)--which would be in line with what AT did with Integra."

On the freeway I loathed the 1.8T as I found it loud and in the case of the Jetta, poorly geared.  With an A4 I also found the 1.8T to be too noisy.  It's like a hornet's nest on the freeway.The TSX on the other hand had a nice long 6th that I could slip into and let the car glide along.  Then again, I prefer that i must go from 6th to 4th or 3rd when I'm on the freeway and I want power in my ZHP.  In 6th, I'm cruising and therefore I want it as quiet and loafing as possible.  The taller the gear the better.  2500 rpm at 85 sounds perfect.Don't get me wrong, I liked the TSX very much, but to me it looked and felt too much like another Accord. I'm not a honda fan, so I didn't see or feel anything accordish in my times with the TSX."
1510,"March 29, 2004 11:38PM",shipo,"Do I think that it has no guts (talking about the 170 HP version)?  Hmmm, I guess that depends on what it's mounted in.  Mounted in a light weight car, say 2,600 pounds, I think it would be great, however, if it is mounted in a 3,400 pound sedan, then no, I don't think it is up to the task.Best Regards,Shipo"
1511,"March 29, 2004 11:59PM",riez,Keep in mind the TSX uses a dragstrip-like 4.73:1 final drive.  That gives it the initial launch.  It also then has overdrive 5th and 6th gears to offset this final drive.  The 6th overdrive is very deep at 0.66:1.  The IS300 uses 3.73:1 final and 0.85: 5th.BMW has been using direct drive 5th (1.00:1) in past E46 323i/325i with various final drives under 3.50:1.  The new 6-speeds bring overdrive.  [My '98 540i6 had a .82 overdrive 6th with a 2.82:1 final drive.]
1512,"March 30, 2004 12:21AM",speedracer3,I think the 1.8T offers very spirited driving for frontrack models. The combination of frontrack and 6 speed or CVT work well also. I think the added weight of Quattro and the Tiptronic is a perfomace killer for the 1.8T. If I wanted Quattro I would have chosen the A4 3.0

This, combined with my own ""seat of the pants"" indicates a low-to-mid seven rating.ryanl1 - Personally, I would choose the TSX over the TL because I value handling and overall balance more than straight-line acceleration.

Thier success is breeding many new ideas, Im sure. I find your comments about the G sedan strange -while the coupe looks like a supercar you were looking for a sedan right?   I liked the fact that the coupe and sedan are so different but look similar enough.  I guess people love or hate the sedan and mostly love the coupe.  If I wasn't looking at coupes I would look at all sedans independently of the coupe sister.  The fact that they are different should be good - the 3 coupe and sedan are virtual twins.

1539,"April  2, 2004  3:38AM",pg48477,"Acura is talking about introducing a revolutionary AWD system, which not only distributes torque front to rear but also left to right. I think it might be available on 05TL.>>>Honda Develops World&#146;s First Super Handling All-Wheel-Drive Available this fall in the Acura RL (North America) and the Legend (Japan) TOKYO - April 1, 2004 --- Honda Motor Co., Ltd. today announced the development of a new Super Handling All-Wheel-Drive system, called SH-AWD, that provides cornering performance that responds faithfully to driver input, and outstanding vehicle stability. A world&#146;s first, the SH-AWD system combines front-rear torque distribution control with independently regulated torque distribution to the left and right rear wheels to freely distribute the optimum amount of torque to all four wheels in accordance with driving conditions. The new system will be available this fall in the Acura RL (North America) and the Legend (Japan). By monitoring driver input and driving conditions, the SH-AWD system determines the optimum front-rear and lateral (left-right) torque distribution. This information is then conveyed to the rear differential, where direct electromagnetic clutches continuously regulate and vary front-rear torque distribution between ratios of 30:70 and 70:30, and lateral torque distribution in the rear wheels between ratios of 100:0 and 0:100. Torque is used not only for propulsion, but for cornering as well, resulting in a significant enhancement in vehicle maneuverability. The SH-AWD system is composed of sensors to detect steering angle, lateral g, and other vehicle information; an ECU; and the rear differential. The direct electromagnetic clutches inside the rear differential, another world&#146;s first, employ electromagnets to obtain precise control over the multi-plate clutches. Built-in search coils monitor the gaps between the electromagnets and the magnetic body to achieve precise, continuously variable torque regulation. The rear differential is also equipped with a built-in acceleration device, yet another world&#146;s first. During cornering, the track of the outside rear wheel normally falls outside the average of the tracks of the front wheels. The outside rear wheel does not rotate fast enough to keep up with the front wheels, preventing efficient transmission of torque. To counteract this problem, the SH-AWD acceleration device alters the gearing to speed up the outside rear wheel&#146;s rotation relative to the front wheels. This reduces torque transmission losses and significantly improves vehicle maneuverability. At Honda, driving pleasure is regarded as one of the most important factors in vehicle development. The new SH-AWD system features &#147;feed-forward&#148; control, which utilizes the degree of driver input to determine appropriate torque distribution. This results in a super-neutral steering feel that responds with optimal faithfulness to the driver&#146;s handling of the steering wheel, realizing outstanding driving comfort and stability.

I'm not an expert but I have not seen anything like it."

1571,"April  3, 2004  2:33PM",kdshapiro,Quadra-drive is heavy duty 4wd system that will deliver 100% of torque to any one wheel. It is meant for keeping the vehicle moving while towing a 5000lbs load.All new awd systems vary the power front to back and left to right as measured by the electronics. BMWs system can operate with any two wheels spinning and will vary the output to any one wheel even going into a curve.

Finally it makes its way to the top of Acura sedan!Did you see my post showing Acura was the only premium brand to lose market share in California between 2001-2003?  Even Lincoln gained some, now that's saying something!  BTW, Infiniti gained the most share during that period.I finally read the MT comparo.  The editors didn't have a fun time in that glorified Accord, did they?  Especially when they had G for comparison.  While more powerful than G, TL got beat in every performance category!

Just curious.  Also, one other thing to consider in sales figures is the distribution channel.  Within 30 miles I have 4 Acura dealers, 3 BMW dealers, 2 Mercedes dealers and 1 Infiniti dealer.  Also, although the G35 RWD sedan is selling near invoice in my area, the G35x and FX models are dealing on an ""MSRP minus"" basis, not an ""Invoice plus"" basis.  Discounts are less than those on the BMW or Acura TL.  Again, probably a reflection of lower supply rather than higher demand for my area.  To me it seems that the Infiniti dealer network size hasn't caught up with the popularity of the G and FX models."

I agree that part of why Infiniti isn't selling even more vehicles is because their dealer network size is pretty small.

It's not good enough that you like the car, it seems important that 7k people this month did too.  This is akin to people who cite box office as proof a movie is good.  $1.8 billion in box office doesn't mean a film's good by default and 7k sales in a month doesn't either.  The Accord sold 30k+ cars last month, I'll flat out say it, the Accord is not a good car.  So 30K people made a bad decision?  Maybe not for them, but I found it bulky, wallowy and just not a fun experience.  On a scale of 1/10, the Accord would rank about 3 or 4 for me.TL is the only FWD that can compete with 330i, G35, RWDer.True, so what do sales have to do with that?  I like the TL.  I do not like the stigma that goes with BMW buyers and I'm not digging the vibe I'm getting from some TL buyers in here too.

Unless they're buying you the car, what anyone else thinks of your purchase should not be relevant.Being the best selling car in any class is a useless stat when it comes to making your buying decision.

I can see how CR could think the TL has more *utility* than a 330i.But now if one is talking near luxury sports sedans, FWD fall short.

The expert must have  based his dissertation on those terrific suspensions on Buicks.People here keep dissing the sales figures. The sales figures are much more of realistic indicator of the buying publics acceptance or rejection of FWD automobiles. The TL is out selling all of the RWD cars that Pat allows us to discuss on this board as entry level luxury performance sedans. I don't believe the majority of car buyers care as much about FWD versus RWD as the very small number of participants on this board do. I know the people here who believe they are different because they don't buy cars lots of other people do will take exception. Taking exception is certainly their right but it doesn't alter the fact that Acura continues to manufacture and sell a lot of really fine FWD cars in a class dominated by RWD cars. The reason is they give a lot of value for the money and that seems to be more important to people than what kind of drivetrain the car has.Pat has sent me to the penalty box lately so I have to be a kinder, gentler commentator.

Now we can debate endlessly on whether that matters to an individual.

Simply put, the 530i, when shod with my winter wheel/tire set, is the finest winter driving vehicle I have ever had the pleasure to push through inclement conditions.The fact is that the RWD cars discussed in this topic, with a good set of winter tires mounted, will run rings around a similar FWD car running Summer tires or even All-Seasons for that matter.

The Max is offered as the top end of the midsize range from Nissan.  The 4 banger accord is specifically designed to appeal to a different buyer.  Do you not grasp that?  The vast majority of buyers don't give a hoot about handling, power or performance - thus the reason cars like the ES330, Accord and Fords/GMs sell well.  Do you think all those 7k people had their decision from sales figuresThe truth?  I think price, Honda reputation and standard equipment drive the majority of TL sales and always have.  A comparable equipment wise 330i would run well over 5k more.  To most buyers, imho, the lack of RWD would mean nothing to them as they buy appliances.  When I help friends/family buy cars and they're looking to drop 30-40k, the general statements are, I need something reliable, something pretty luxurious, its got to have a little power.  So I'll take them out and if they drive a 33k version of a G35, TL, A4 and 325i they'll walk away most impressed by the price/power/equipment of the G, TL.  Only one person still wanted the 325 over the past two years...he fell in love with the handling but he drives cars hard (G was number 2 for him fwiw).designmanBlueguy can't figure out how you hate FWD yet like the TL. Tends to be confusing but is indicative of what the TL has going for itself.I recognize the excellent value.  Look at all you get for that scary low price!  If I'd gone TL (which was not out last year in May), I'd have saved a big chunk of change and had a car that would offer probably 90% of what I got (minus of couse the more useless visual and tactile cues I prefer on the 3 series).  If money or equipment had been the primary determining factor in my purchase I would have gotten the TSX (remember no TL then).

As such, I don't need to replace them until mid to late April.Regarding the new TL (a design by the way that is what, 8 years newer than my 530i), yes, I have no doubt that it will out accelerate my 530i in snowy conditions, however, given its front end bias, I'd bet that the 530i will stop shorter and probably handle better.

All nice cars and some I know for sure I would be very happy with ( as in M5 or 350Z ).I wish we could see honest discussion here about some things that aren't what we thought they would be or need improving on the cars we bought. Most of the critic isms are aimed at cars we don't own. I'll go first..what the hell was Acura thinking when they designed the steering wheel location relative to the instrument panel ? You can't see the speedometer when the wheel is adjusted to where you want it. Maybe it is different for others depending on their driving position but neither my wife or I can see the speedometer with the wheel where we want it.That doesn't detract from my driving enjoyment enough to outweigh the things I do like however.I am going to drive three hours each way to play golf on Friday and one of the reasons is because I like driving my TL and I get the best of two worlds..a nice course and a nice drive. I am positive I would have an equally good time in G35 or a 330I or certainly in that M5.I bought a TL because it suited me in the areas I considered important...price, styling and also it was  car my wife also enjoys driving.

1735,"April  7, 2004  5:10PM",jmess,Some things that Riez didn't mention:1. You can't select or hold 1st gear with the e-shift automatic gear box. If you launch from a stop with something less than 2/3rd throttle it will short shift to 2nd to save fuel.2. The front dash side vents have chrome stripes on the louver directional levers that reflect in the door glass about eye level with the side mirrors. The solution is to black them out with a marker pen.3. You can't deactivate the skid control. I found VSC to be a little intrusive during a trip to the local race track on a wet day 4. The traction control is way to sensitive. Fortunately you can turn it off so you can take full advantage of the Limited slip.5. Shock valving. on the e-shift car is a little too soft when you approach the handling limits of the car.6. The paint chips far too easily. A clear bra is your friend in this case.7. I have the SportCross version and it doesn't have an internal rear hatch release button or lever. The hatch is manually open from the outside when all the doors are unlocked.

In any case I think 300HP is good enof to compete with 6 cylinders versions of i's competition. One of the reasons M45 did so poorly is luck of V6. Most of GS, E and 5 are being sold with 6 cylinders, in fact 80% of GS is I6. I don't think Acura wants to spend money on something they can't sell, if the come up with full size sedan maybe they will build V8.

1773,"April  8, 2004 12:36PM",shipo,"When one goes to Europe, one realizes that BMW is just as family and economically oriented as are the Japanese marques.  The only real difference is that BMW leaned toward the performance and handling niche whereas the Japanese leaned toward the simplicity and reliability niche, historically speaking.To put this in context, I was doing a project for MB-USA in the mid 1990s and the folks from Stuttgart liked what I did for the folks in Montvale, and shipped me over there for a while.  Due to the fact that I was a contractor, their insurance regulations prohibited me from being assigned a car from the pool reserved for the MB-USA folks, so they rented me a small BMW.  Said rental had four doors, a 1.6 or a 1.8 liter mill (I think it was the 1.6), crank windows, no A/C, cloth seats and a simple radio without a cassette.  To make matters worse, I was driving north out of Austria early one morning (about 4:00 AM) and the 316i was laboring up a long hill south of Ulm, flat out at something like 80 mph when I saw a pair of headlights catching me, FAST.

""No one can say the bimmer engineers aren't good at refining a sedan and engineering the heck out of it over time.  But in its first try nissan bested the true class competitor (330i) and is redefining the expectations of this segment.  It's truly a joy to own a G and hear people compare the car to much more powerful or expensive machines such as m3 and any 5 series as the car seems to find it self compared to so often.  The m3 is over 50k and is not much bigger than a civic.  While very beautiful and classic in design it's very pricey for the propeller on the hood and the extra oophm.  Worth it - maybe if you can swing it.  Maybe last year and not next year tho.  Its another whole class the M3 sits in with a 911 carerra and the vette that we are comparing a 27k car to....very cool to me.  Now as for the VQ being tame - yes it's not pushing all the M hp/liter but thats a $17,000 motor with a 1% failure rate from such a long stroke working at 9k rpm.  Nice but quirky and expensive.  The VQ can easily perform 300hp without any major tweaks and could possibly get to 340 or so if tuner like the M guys tune the VQ.  Maybe still not the same high hp/litre as m3, but much cheaper much more reliable and still more productive than 99% of the v6's sold in the us.  I'll take it.For 1k you can take the existing 260 in the sedan and turn it into 290 or so.  Thats an 11% increase with minor work and dollars.  This engine screams to do more and the short stroke and balanced v-6 are not as smooth as a straight 6 inherintly but find another v that even comes close...and costs so little to make."

This is the performance package equipped version, and perhaps a juiced one that C&D got at that.330 perf package costs way more than what you can get into a G35 for.  If you ""tuned"" your VQ yourself spending the money you saved you'd end up ahead.BMW doesn't have any voo-doo HP tricks that others lack.  It's a question of money.  The specific output of the 325 is very low, just look at a 98-00 Duratec 2.5 pumping 200hp... that was 6 years ago mind you.I also notice that none of the TL lovers here are touching the Motor Trend comparison.  About the torque steer, they basically wrote ""sure you could live with it, but why would you want to""? (not an exact quote, i don't have the mag here in front of me)To sum it up:The G35 dominated since there was no BMW competition.  But the CTS keeps creeping up in these comparisons, coming in second this time.  It pulled a 6.6 with an auto, which will probably mean a 6.2 when the M6 hits lots this June as an '05.  So I could drive a 5 series in size and comfort that goes 6.2 for as little as $32k or I could force my friends to cram into the back of a 3 series and either spend a little more money for equal performance (regular 330) or spend way more for slightly better performance (330 perf package).  No thanks, I'm not into paying more for less just to have what everyone else thinks is ""cool"".  I work hard for my money and the status symbol factor of BMW does nothing for me.For me, a person who needs to use the back seat at times, but still wants a balanced sports sedan the G35/CTS are clearly the value leaders.Brian"

Nissan's had the I class for a long time and it was in the same market segment: entry level lux.  The G comes a good 10 years into Nissan's first failed attempts.It's truly a joy to own a G and hear people compare the car to much more powerful or expensive machines such as m3 and any 5 series as the car seems to find it self compared to so often. Who would compare a G to an M3?  There is no comparison.  That's beyond silly.  comparos to the 530 make sense.  The 545?  No way.The m3 is over 50kStarts at 45k.  and is not much bigger than a civic.What?  Regardless, I find the 330i to be too big - that's why I'm looking forward to the M2 in 2006/7.Worth it - maybe if you can swing it. Maybe last year and not next year tho. Its another whole class the M3 sits in with a 911 carerra and the vette that we are comparing a 27k car to....very cool to me. You're the only one doing that.  Quite frankly the G's a fun car, but it's not in the same league as the M3, 911 or Vette - those are flat out performance cars.  When you're running sub 5 second 60s then it'll be called a GT-R. The VQ can easily perform 300hp without any major tweaks and could possibly get to 340 or so if tuner like the M guys tune the VQ. Again, so, it's also much larger.  We've seen over 350 out of the 3.2 on the M3 CSL.For 1k you can take the existing 260 in the sedan and turn it into 290 or so.Stock for stock.  I don't care what mods are out there.  Kids are on the road with Civics pushing over 400 hp.  Doesn't change the fact it's still a Civic.The G's a fine car but it's not Nissan's first foray into entry-level-lux and it's certainly not in the league of cars like the M3, 911 or Vette, STi, Evo.  To believe it is, can only be described as foolishness."
1782,"April  8, 2004  3:54PM",blueguydotcom,"Why would I buy a 330i base?  It was a fun car but if BMW makes a better one, why wouldn't one go for it?  I desperately wanted an M3 sedan to be frank.  If BMW sold it, it'd be sitting in my garage at this moment.  But if ifs and nuts were candy and nuts...Regardless, this all began because someone babbled about the G35 and TL outgunning the 3 series.  I don't see it that way.  I see that they finally caught up with it - while posting high HP numbers.  And still they aren't winning comparos straight up.  It's only when adding price that they win some of the comparo....and to some buyers, price wasn't the determining issue when buying a car for fun.  Afterall, it's a toy.  If i'm tossing 33k on a car, 6k more is not that big of a deal in the scheme of things.  If 6k means 10% more happiness, the trade off is a no brainer, in my opinion.  I think in the end I'm buying my sports sedan for a different reason: fun.  Roominess, bang for the buck, modability don't enter my equation."
1783,"April  8, 2004  3:56PM",shipo,"While the CTS may have decent acceleration, it's the rest of the package that turns me off.  It looks like a Piccaso characature of what I'm not sure, the interior is a serious turn off to me, and don't get me started on the handling which felt to me less stable and precise than our family Caravans much less than either of my BMWs.Personally, I think that the G and the 330i (with just the regular SP, not the ZHP) are well matched, the G has a little more room and depending on the day may be a little faster, the 330i has a higher quality interior and depending upon the day is a better handler.  I will not speculate on the E46 replacement but I wouldn't bet against the BMW engineers on that one.Best Regards,Shipo"
1784,"April  8, 2004  4:08PM",nickjc,"I rode in one the other day.  It had the ""performance package/option,"" and stickered around $44K.  Ride is firm, but tolerable.  Had the 3.6 liter engine, which seemed atheletic enough.  Nice sized interior and trunk.  Way too much plastic inside, with some cost cutting parts evident here and there.I'd like to try the CTS-V in the near future, but I suspect a test drive will be hard to obtain.  And I still cannot decide how I feel about the exterior design, although it is beginning to grow on me, I think...BTW, the 2003 E500 I drove is quite nice, and probably can be had for a relative bargain."
1785,"April  8, 2004  5:05PM",shipo,"It's been over a year since I drove a CTS, and I don't remember if the ""Performance Package"" was included on the one that I drove, or for that matter if that package even existed late in 2002.  Regardless, the car was much too soft and unstable when pushed for my tastes.  Maybe I should give it another chance.  On second thought, maybe I'll wait until the next generation when, hopefully, the look is not so objectionable.Best Regards,Shipo"
1786,"April  8, 2004  5:09PM",chrisboth,Hey just becasue im tickled that everyone points to the m3 when hp/ltre of the G is mentioned doesn't mean I think they compare.  I never said nor dillusionally consider the G to be in carerra territory.27k baby and I'm not the one bringing m3 and 5 series up in this thread but it seems they enter the equation when one wants to liken the VQ to something less than the supposedly exclusive world of overpriced BMW tuning (still good but pricey).  Blueguy - i forget that the g20 called itslelf a bimmer beater - i forget it actually exists.  The good old days of reaming the american consumer with simple marketing to undereducated buyers is coming to a close!  I made all those mistakes myself.  Infiniti learned that the hard way.and ps stock for stock i think the numbers are right on for the g and zhp in everything.
1787,"April  8, 2004  5:37PM",speedracer3,"Infinti never had sport sedans nor did they ever compete in the arena. Infinitis were just more luxurious versions of their Nissan siblings.G20 = SentraI30 = MaximaQX = Pathfinder.M30 coupe = probably a cousin to the 300ZX/240SX.The Q stood alone, as having no Nissan relation. Infiniti got it right on the first shot with the G35...that a HUGE accomplishment as their first foray into true sport sedan segments."
1788,"April  8, 2004  5:48PM",sawyerjon,"Just wanted to add my .02...I took the CTS for the 24 hour test drive, it had the luxury package, not sport.  In comparison, I had driven the 2003 with the 3.2 engine, there is a major difference in performance.  I previously owned a '98 3 series, and can honestly say that the handling performance of the CTS is on par with the bimmer, in everyday driving that is. On the track, it maybe a different story, but for real world driving, the Caddy performed well above my expectations (especially when you add in the fact it is a larger vehicle)."
1789,"April  8, 2004  6:51PM",blueguydotcom,"Regardless, the [cts] was much too soft and unstable when pushed for my tastes. That was my experience with a fully loaded manual model when it came out.  I was shocked at how poorly the car handled after all the bogus raves in magazines.Which reminds me, Autoweek, Carconnection, Carpoint all carried stories about how Detroit was overtaking Euro cars for reliability.  The tone of the writing suggested for some weird reason the writers were excited and the excitement should be felt elsewhere.  That's sort of the reason I take reviews of American products with a grain of salt.  It's almost like the reviewers are trying hard to like the vehicles."
1790,"April  8, 2004  6:58PM",blueguydotcom,"Overpriced in your eyes - which is all that matters when buying - to me the price was right.  A G35 manual at 27k with the features I required (leather, moon, xenons) still wouldnt be acceptable to my wallet because my heart wouldn't have been satisfied.I've spent the first 28 years of my life being sensible with car purchases - I'd always take the better deal over the vehicle that really stirred my soul.  Once I began looking in that over 25k bracket I decided I wouldn't settle for a car that didn't get me excited the moment I saw it.  We're all hardwired differently.  My priorities were fun, manual, 4 doors over - price wasn't going to determine the purchase.  never again if I can help it.  I love cars too much to settle."
1791,"April  8, 2004  7:00PM",scott1,"I agree with sawyerjon on the performance of the CTS with the new 3.6 liter engine. I traded in a navy blue 99 corvette for my luxury sport package equipped CTS, so I know how a true sports car is supposed to handle. While the CTS obviously doesn't have the horsepower that the corvette does, it handles extremely well...with tight responsive steering and brisk throttle response. The engine has a nice refined purrr to it too.  Before ordering the CTS, I  spent a month driving every other competitor I could think of, from BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, Infinity, even a Lincoln LS. The only one I didn't consider was Honda/Acura. I had a really bad ownership experience with a Honda some years ago..and can't bring myself to buy another.   For what I am looking for in a car at this point in my life, the CTS fit the bill better then anything else. It has room and comfort, very satisfying handling and acceleration, the luxury feel that I think I deserve, and bold styling that sets it apart from the crowd and turns heads on the road.Scott"
1792,"April  8, 2004  7:14PM",chrisboth,"PS i dont have the stripper either so i know what you mean.  As far as engine prowess you'd need to get the m3 to really have anything over on the G regardless of displacement.  As we i believe agree, the zhp and the G sedan stocker is dead even for almost any category.  At upper highway speeds the G may have a chance to outshine a tad.  And really price is an issue or we'd all be in maserati or lambo.  Price is not an issue for a certain bracket or segment but you are still locked into that segment.  I got to save 7 k from the 40k zhp and i can hang with it so i dont feel i compromised within my  class...and ZHP is really a class higher imo (between m and 330)."
1793,"April  8, 2004  7:16PM",shipo,"...so the handling on the CTS has improved, what about the interior and even more so, the exterior?  I just couldn't bring a face like that into my garage.Best Regards,Shipo"
1794,"April  8, 2004  8:25PM",bxd20,"CTS interior got some mild updates (a little more wood, a little more classy lighting of instruments).  Full re-work for 2006 model.  Exterior has had minor updates as well (trunk lid dropping that ugly grey and gaining a body color license bezel, better wheels, better onstar antenna style and positioning).Ultimately, you have to like the styling of the car you're buying if you're a car guy.  If you don't, no use trying to force it.Dropping an extra $6000 is an easy decision for you? More power to you.  You eluded to a perf package 330 being $39k by saying if you were spending 33 what was a $6k more.

On that grade, what with all of the traffic that road gets, the asphalt in each lane has been pressed into what sort of looks like an old country dirt lane.  The lane divider regions and the middle of the lanes are an easy two to three inches higher than the rutted area where the tires typically run.  When climbing that hill with anything beyond the power necessary to maintain your speed, the car starts to wander around the ruts.  It is a very nervous feeling, and depending upon the quality of the car and its suspension, the phenomena ranges from mildly distracting to highly annoying, in fact, I&#146;ve driven a few cheap rentals up that grade that were down right scary.

But, regardless, its interesting that their January test of the car netted a much lower number.  If .89 is true, then I certainly wouldn't bother with the A-spec pack.  Interestingly enough, the January review also calls attention to the fact that the .81 was not up to snuff against the G35s .87.  So, what happens?  The TL pulls a .89 and the G35 pulls a .90 in the March comparo?  Hmmmmm....And, by the way, according to the April issue, the 330i with performance pack pulled a .86 (.83 without)."

Great road to drive leading up to a mountain pass and through a gorgeous canyon with a river running next to the road. The TL is such a nice road car. I wasn't throwing it around as some do mostly because the road is notorious for state police and sure enough they were out at 7:00 AM when I was driving over. Sun was up at 7:00 and I drove home in 80 degree temperatures. I really got a dose of what a near luxury sport sedan is about. The car is extremely comfortable, great sound system, fun to drive fast when you can and I got 30 miles per gallon coming home because there was enough traffic you couldn't really drive fast. I didn't feel any torque steer and I was doing 80 through some of the corners going over in the morning. There surely are some differences in the cars being discussed here but the numbers are so small as to be almost inconsequential in most cases (.89 versus .90 skidpad..5.6 versus 5.8 0-60)I believe the kind of driving I did today is the true measure of a near luxury sport sedan because I think it represents the kind of driving that 99% of the people who own these cars actually do. I am sure that my trip would have been just as enjoyable in a 330I or a G or an IS 300. I just happen to own a TL and today I was really pleased that I do."

By redesigning the power train to use equal length half shafts between the transaxle and wheels, the tendency towards torque steer can be greatly reduced. The other cure is to keep off the gas"

Great engine and steering. Things I didn't like:- Interior is only fair after having an Audi- Steering - I drove about 70 mph around a sweeping freeway interchange ramp. There's a spot where the pavement changes and there's a 1/2-1 inch elevation difference. When I hit it in the G35 the steering wheel wanted to jerk out of my hand - THAT'S the sort of real-world handling I DON'T like! I tried the same spot and speed later in my A4 and there was virtually no 'kick' in the steering wheel.

1866,"April 12, 2004  8:46PM",sweetc230,"From someone who has owned an '03 C230 sport sedan (6spd manual) for a little over one year, the C-class is CLEARLY the better choice.  First of all, the RWD and sport suspension make the C class a better handling car (sorry TL/TSX lovers, but I am another ""RWD or bust"" kind of guy).  Secondly, my car MSRP was 32K and I paid 31K for C2 package (rain sensor, power rear sunshade and power sunroof), 6 disc changer, heated seats and premium Bose system.  IMO, the look of the C CLass is MUCH classier and all around better looking than the non descript Honda lineup; especially the sport sedans 17inch wheel/tire combo and side/front/rear skirting.  And if cjs2002 can wait for the '05 MB cclass sport sedan the interior is far better looking than the '03 or '04.  The TL interior is a nice piece, but it still screams Accord.  And in the reliability department, my car has only been to the shop for it's one routine/free scheduled maintenance at 10K (I currently have 14K miles).  Honestly, cjs2002, you won't go wrong with either car, but the C CLass was an easy choice for me last January when I ordered mine.  Even over the much loved G35 sedan. . . .IMO I just don't love the exterior or interior of the G.

The car is a little under powered for me and that is why I am on the G35 board thinking about a new car in about a year. I will say the reliability on my MB has not been too bad. The fuel gauge was about 2 gallons off and replaced (the sending unit) and the tape deck door would not open - the entire head unit was replaced. Everything under warranty. So that was 2 problems. If I bought a Japanese car I would expect 1 problem in 32,000 miles. The car is solid as brick - no squeeks or rattles at all. According to the last service my brake pads are not even at 50% wear which is not bad cosidering 80% of my driving is in the city. The 6-speed can easily get 30 miles per gallon on the highway. I do wish the interior was a bit wider and like I said I want more power. However, whenever I see an officer around a blind bend with a radar gun I am glad I dont have the extra HP.

1887,"April 14, 2004 12:14AM",glenford,"Finally got to drive a G35x today (nearest dealer is 50+ miles away) on my way to the NY auto show.  Looking for some feedback from others who have driven both this and either a 325xi or 330xi - I drove both of those a month ago (that dealer only 45 miles away - in a different direction).My needs list - AWD, highly reliable, ""compact"" size, fun to drive, and it falls off after that.  Price is a consideration.My observations:AWD performance - I'll never know from a test drive not in nasty snow - assume they are both good.Price - G35x, by a couple thousand or more, depending on if I compare to 325 or 330.Reliability - varies by the individual car, of course, but Infiniti looks to have (significantly?) better oddsSize - comparable, but the BMW seemed a little cramped to me (the oft-repeated comments about the ""grade"" of the interior between the two is of lesser concern to me - both are fine)Fun - This is a little harder, since the lag between my drive times was long, but here's how it felt, and I'm looking for your observations:There is a noticeable power difference between the 325 and the other 2.  Maybe daily it doesn't matter, but it's easy to feel.  Otherwise, the power seemed to me to come on much more smoothly in the 330 than the g35.  G35 might ride better, but I also felt that it was a little over-sensitive to minor inputs, and I didn't feel that in the BMW.  They all braked strongly (as much as I can test in a test drive).I'm not looking to restart the ""I love my xxx, it's the best"" wars, but I would be interested in hearing from those who have driven both (or all 3).  All are seemingly very nice - even near-luxury (!) cars.Interesting cars from the show (in their AWD versions, which sometimes means coming soon) - Lexus 2005 GS, Saab 9-2 (even if it is a Subaru ;-), Acura RL (but too big for me). Acura said all their cars would be AWD if I wanted to wait. Infinity M (again too big, though).  It was crowded down there today, bad weather or not."
1888,"April 14, 2004  1:20AM",rderizans,"I had a '99 328i for just over five years and purchased a G35x back in January.  I test drove the 325ix and 330ix as well as the A4 1.8T and 3.0.  My opinions were similar to yours:- BMW engines are the smoothest out there and my 328i was the smoothest of any car I've ever driven (I think they get better with age).  If the ABS system hadn't gone (~$3000 estimated to repair), I'd still be driving it for sure.  The G35 engine is great and VERY powerful, but somehow not as much fun to rev to the redline as the BMW engines.- 325 and Audi engines just didn't have enough torque for me.  The Audi felt nice, but the throttle response wasn't there for me.- G35 is bigger than the other cars.  Significantly in overall size, somewhat less significantly in interior room but still, it's a bigger car with more room, which was a positive for me.- Handling was similar in all - excellent.As you can see, I like all of the cars.  In the end, the decision for me came down to value and reliability.  The G35x simply is a great value when compared to the BMWs and Audis.  Sure, the interior plastics aren't quite up to snuff, but the leather is nicer (in my opinion), it's the most powerful in the group, and your reliability odds are definitely better with Inifiniti.No matter which you choose, you'll love the car.  It's a great choice to have!"
1889,"April 14, 2004  2:57AM",jrock65,"I agree w/ rderizans that the leather in the G is nicer.  But I prefer softer leathers.The biggest weakness of the G is grade of interior materials (other than seats), but if you're not bothered by them, the G35x should be a top candidate.  Seeing that the power difference (or lack thereof) in the 325ix was noticeable to you, I'd recommend not getting it.  Might nag you constantly.  The 330ix is a fine machine, you can't go wrong with it either."

I must admit before I test drove the 325ci(w/sport)I expected the car to be a dog and much to my surprise it was reasonably fast. The 330i(w/sport) was a wonderful car to drive. It was smooth and felt like it took far less effort to pick up speed. I have nothing negative to say about how the 330i drives. I just think the look is a little dated to me and the 3 series around here are far too common. When my G35coupe was in for service I was given a G35X( I happened to get caught in the middle of an unexpected snow storm. It handled very well. I never had any problems the entire day. Now, it was not on the same level as my wife's A6 quattro but the car handling capabilities are more than adequate. I prefer the interior of the 3 series but I agree with some others on this board with regard to the seats. The seats are more comfortable in the G."

When you make regular service appointment, they put you at least 3 weeks later, and give you a 2004 loaner.1. In March, something was wrong on the car, I called, they scheduled it 3 weeks later. I asked, if they can make it earlier, because I was not sure if the problem was critical or not. They said, they can, but they don't have loaner, I have to rent a car at my own expense.2. 10 days ago, my car was hit by a lost-control car, some bodyworks need to be done, I have to rent a car myself. ( I don't blame them for this one.)3. This moring, my car stopped on highway ( see my previous post). The malfunction fuel gauge showed that I have half tank of gas, actually the tank is empty. When I call the dealer, they said they can treat it as urgent service, but, again, I have to rent a car at my own expense, because they don't have loaner.You CAN get a loaner, if you schedule the service several weeks earlier. If it is anything urgent comes up, sorry, you have to rent a car yourself. The problems are:1. They want to cut loaner cost by having less loaners,2. The MB cars have too many problems, people are busy bringing in their cars to get fixed.I hope I haven't bought this car!  I am thinking about selling this car before the warranty expires. I just can't afford the time, the money and the patience. I just can't!Finally, a funny thing, when I was at the dealerseveral days ago, I overheard a lady who drives a coupe complained a problem, I told her I have had that problems about 10 times.

Five of them are automatics & one is manual; however, the one manual has basically every option (including the overpriced nav) and they want $34K for it.  The autos have the prem package and are stickering for 30-31K.  I have always owned manuals, but I have been strongly considering going the auto route for traffic's sake.  Did you test drove both?

It may take them a few years to catch up but we all know how patient the Koreans are. They've come a long way and have proven their capabilities with cars like the XG350 (Hyundai's flagship luxury model) which is recommended by CR.

Even if Hyundai puts a 3.5L V6 with 250hp and 240 torque in  a Sonata, what about the tranny, braking, suspension, etc, and all of those other important components that keep that power in check.  I do not think that Hyundai is up to that level of performance yet.  I traded in a 2002 Sonata V6 for A Mitsu GTS, only because I wanted a family size car with above average performance.  I agree that a separate luxury division would be better for Hyundai/Kia, because there would be a stigma:  Who would pay $30K for an entry level luxury Korean car, when you can buy a loaded Accord/Camry/Altima/Galant/6, etc."

Remember Toyota, Honda and Datsun in the early years? Would you have bought one of those cars? Hyundai certainly deserves a lot more credit than what most people give the company, and if they play their cards right, they have a very bright future ahead of them.

""But I am not surprised to hear that Hyundai products are getting better."" im also surprised 2 hear that they rank near honda. in fact, since im not a public figure being quoted in a well circulated broadsheet, i would go s far s 2 say, that, ranking hyundai as above average cals into question the credibility of their ranking process."

1935,"April 21, 2004  7:20AM",280hp,"i remember toyota. honda and datsun from the early days. they didnt even try 2 enter this end of the market till 20 years later. after dominating the mainstream car segment.part of the reason they could survive those early years was the lack of competition and the unique circumstance of having oil price rise suddenly.those 2 pre conditions for survival no longer exists.as to hyundai = below average reliability, i think thats fairly well accepted and what most people think. very few people will actually accpet that hyundai have japanese car reliability until they really start to see 10 year old hyundais still trouble free and on our roads.that may yet happen, but not for another 10 years or so. may be longer.in the meanwhile, will hyundai run out of money ?"

The warranty's are nearly costless according to insiders as there is no tranferability and most people wont keep the car for more than 4 years.  Thier repuation is much improved and with US and japanse investements in Huyundia they will only get better.  They weren't around in 1980 here in US and are now 3rd largerst carmaker I believe and sell more than Chrysler here at home.
1940,"April 21, 2004  1:49PM",fjm1,My .02: Aggressive TQM coupled with very low total costs of operation spell success for Hyundai.  They will not target premium brands until after they have big market share on volume niches like compact and mid size family sedan.  The biggest wild card I see is their politics. Could fowl up the whole plan.

They still have a ways to go before they catch up with the big 3 Japanese manufacturers. My biggest beef with Hyundai is that their designs are derivative and not very original.

1944,"April 22, 2004  5:06AM",saugatak,"S. Korea's credit ratings had little to do with N. Korea.  Their problem was that they tied up too much capital in unproductive conglomerates whose ROI was awful because they were not run by real businessmen, but well connected people who were able to obtain interest free government loans and guarantees, which basically encouraged rampant overexpansion and covered up their mistakes.For example, the South Korean domestic car industry is large enough to support only 1, maybe 2 domestic manufacturers.  Instead, S. Korea had Hyundai, Kia, Daewoo and for a brief time, Samsung.It is insane that Korea had 4 major manufacturers when Germany can support only 2 and the U.S. had 3 (until recently).Now that Hyundai is the only major car manufacturer in Korea and doesn't have to worry about insane competition in its home market, they can focus on building better product.Personally, I can't see Hyundai entering the luxury market until they can compete on a level playing field with Toyota, Honda and Nissan in terms of quality and reputation.  When the big 3 of Japan made their move into luxury, what made it possible was the fact that they had cemented their reputations as building solid, reliable cars.  Until Hyundai acquires that bulletproof rep, I can't see people associating Hyundai with that luxury brand image.OTOH, if Hyundai keeps up the good work, it won't necessarily take long.  Look how fast Ghosn turned around Nissan/Infinit."
1945,"April 22, 2004  5:36AM",kahunah,"""Until Hyundai acquires that bulletproof rep, I can't see people associating Hyundai with that luxury brand image.""Back in 1986, Honda did not exactly have a bulletproof reputation nor could most people associate Honda with a luxury brand image. Yet, they did the unthinkable and launched a luxury car brand...Acura. Five years later in 1991, the Legend Coupe won Motor Trend's prestigious Import Car of the Year trophy. The same year, the Integra took the laurels as one of Car & Driver's Ten Best. The Integra would continue to make the Ten Best list in four of the next ten years.

1946,"April 22, 2004  9:31AM",saugatak,"Not disagreeing with any of your points.  If Hyundai makes a great car at a great price, yes perhaps they could compete.But there are several factors working against that.First, the competition now is much more intense than ever before.  Cadillac is producing nice cars, Chrysler is coming out with interesting product, the [non-permissible content removed]. big 3 are in the game now, and though MB and BMW have stumbled, they're still major players.What worked back then won't necessarily work now.Second, I don't know Hyundai's cash situation, but I don't think it's as good as Honda or Toyota when they launched their luxury brands.In any case, I don't think Hyundai belongs in this thread since they are not yet considered luxury.Hopefully Hyundai will follow the path of the Japanese.  More quality cars, choices and competition can only benefit consumers.What will be interesting is what happens when the Chinese come up with their own car brands and start entering the world market."

We are only waiting for the ""Official"" pronouncements from the media to validate this.  This is not even considering the Premium Subaru 7 Pass that is in the works. Now to true Entry Level Luxury Performance SedansHere is the Hirsch Aero Stuffhttp://www.saab-performance.com/SAAB 9-5 AERO TAKES OFF WITH A HIRSCH PERFORMANCE PACKAGE Already known for its responsive performance, contemporary design and world-class safety, the sporty Saab 9-5 Aero gets a bit more extreme with the introduction of the Saab Performance by Hirsch enhancement package. Saab's Hirsch package for the 9-5 Aero gives the growing number of enthusiast customers a chance to express their individuality with significant engine and chassis upgrades and sporty styling treatments for the interior and exterior. Customers can mix and match options, as desired. The Saab Performance by Hirsch package upgrades the Trionic engine control module, turbocharger, intercooler and intake pipes to provide a 22 percent horsepower boost to the Saab 9-5 Aero's 2.3-liter turbo engine - from 250 to 305 hp. The torque also rises, from 258 to 309 lbs.-ft. These numbers would provide the Saab 9-5 Aero with 133 horsepower per liter of displacement - a feat unmatched not only by other luxury sports sedans and wagons, but also unmatched by most sports cars. Other enhancements include a full sports exhaust system, including dual tailpipes, performance brakes, a lowered chassis with sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch alloy wheels. Bystanders will know something other than the standard 9-5 Aero passed them when they see the sports mesh grille insert, front bumper assembly with integrated spoiler and unique contoured rear bumper that come with the Hirsch package. Plus, the 9-5 SportWagon gets a spoiler on the rear bridge, while the sedan gets a trunk-mounted lip spoiler. Inside, the Hirsch package offers sports leather trim for the seats and door inserts, brushed aluminum door handles, aluminum pedals, sport steering wheel and a unique finish for the main fascia, including the information and audio displays. The Saab Performance by Hirsch package for the 9-5 Aero is the result of the long-term agreement between Saab Automobile AB and Hirsch Performance AG, the Swiss company with extensive experience in customizing Saab cars. Saab Performance by Hirsch products are fully guaranteed by Saab and Hirsch. HIRSCH PERFORMANCE PACKAGE FOR THE SAAB 9-5: Upgrades of Trionic ECM, turbocharger, intercooler, intake pipe Horsepower boosted to 305 bhp max Torque increased to 309 lbs.-ft. Sports exhaust with dual pipes Performance brakes Lowered chassis with sports-tuned suspension 18-inch alloy wheels Sports mesh grille insert New front bumper assembly with integrated spoiler Contoured rear bumper assembly with sculpted side sill extensions Roof-mounted rear bridge spoiler (wagon) or trunk-mounted lip spoiler (sedan) Sports leather interior, including seats and door inserts New interior fascia finish, including information and audio display Brushed aluminum interior door handles Aluminum pedals Sports steering wheel Lobbying to persuade Saab to sell this kit in the US.

1953,"April 22, 2004  7:17PM",saugatak,"Kicking the old RL is a cheapshot . . . nobody defends the old RL, but the new RL looks pretty nice and if it's SH-AWD works as advertised, with the 300 HP v6 (best in class aside from insanely priced M3 and M5), I think the new RL will do pretty well and probably raise the prestige of the Acura brand.Until Acura incorporates SH-AWD into their entire lineup, they're going to be considered a tweener brand b/c, like it or not, luxury is now associated with RWD or AWD.  Some claim a v8 is necessary for lux as well, but I don't agree with that because very few people elect v8s for their sedans, even when available.  I would, however, like to see Acura incorporate a V8 (or IMA or other torque boosting tech.) in their SUVs which are in serious need of a low end torque boostHowever, there's nothing wrong with tweener luxury brands.  I think it's great that you can get a TL or G35 for approx. $20k less than the equivalent BMW or MB (I'm comparing 5 and C class here, not 3 series b/c it's just too small).I know there are fans of Acura and Infiniti who are annoyed with the MB/BMW/Lexus snobbery, but honestly, is it really a good thing for the consumer if both Acura and Infiniti climb up the prestige ladder a la Lexus?  What do I get out of that?  The right to pay more for the same car?  The feeling of superiority from the badge?Frankly, I'm hoping that Acura and Infiniti continue to produce quality vehicles yet remain tweener brands.  If you race me in my TL or G35 (narrowed down my choice to these 2) in your Lexus/BMW/MB and I lose, it's because my wallet is so much heavier than yours."

So, aside from the c230 they ought to be indistinguishable in volume.  So, i guess it depends on the timber and freqency you're used to.  I like how the 3 sounds, but i know it's taste.

But the point that came through at the end is true: All the cars in this segment are very good at doing what they're made to do and selecting between them reflects more on the priorities of the buyer than the superiority of one car versus another. The TL is selling well because it is currently fitting the priorities of more buyers with $30-40 K to spend on a performance sedan than the others. Yes, a big part of that is subjective (new model/styling, buzz from good reviews) but when you take a bunch of cars that all perform great, its the subjective stuff that makes the difference.I bought the TL because it performs great, I never had a problem with torque steer (for the information of those overly attached to RWD) and in the end the styling and technology (love the bluetooth) were better than the rest. Especially for the $.You guys pick what you like, the world be damned but everyone else is buying what they like, and a lot of us like the TL best."

Of course, we'll have to see if BMW pushes xdrive downstream to the 3-series and gets rid of their current AWD setup.I think a lot of people are waiting (including myself), not for the redesign of the exterior/interior, which I like on all models, but the bump-up of HP/torque under the hood.BMW needs to go back to basics, which are all around competent vehicles with class leading HP, and a dash of Valvetronic technology thrown in for good measure.

2039,"May  7, 2004 11:48PM",darnac,"Not to take this too off topic but since we are discussing the audio sytstems in comparable vehicles stereo (2 channel) is and probably will always be the audiophile's choice. Music reproduction is not about being in the center of it. Having played orchestral brass for many years you do not want to sit in the center of music. I dont think you would care either for the way a rock band sounds from between the singer and the drum kit. Music reproduction is about creating a sound stage that accurately reflects the original true source. When you go to the concert whether it is classical or rock the sound starts in front of you. There are no speakers at the rear. Room dynamics will bounce sound all over the place and these diffractions generally speaking should be avoided. 5.1 is what Hollywood uses and for that purpose (movies) it probably is best. Top Gun with the planes flying front to back is best created by 5.1, 5.2 or what are they now talking about 6.2 with a speaker overhead or something. It is a fact that DVD-A sounds much better than CD so from that standpoint the Acura has a big advantage. We may see some manufacture going for the better still SACD but I have not heard anything yet. If any of you are ever in Las Vegas in January they have the annual audiophile manufactures convention. They have dozens of rooms with some systems costing upwards of $100,000.95% of the rooms are 2-channel stereo and most of those rooms use analogue (records) not digital sources."

First you are comparing it with a coupe G35 and everybody knows that the coupes are (i) priced higher (ii) considered more rare and thus unlikely to get any discounts. Since the acura is a sedan, you should compare with the g35 sedan. On top of everything you are comparing with the g35 manual transmission coupe which is the rarest and highest performing g35 version. It is harder to get discounts on that car ... usually each dealership only has one of them and is not worried about being able to sell it. Also you obviously preferred the accura which means you did not bargin for a better price for the infiniti. If you compare a G35 sedan with a TL sedan the bargained for prices should be about the same. I would still recomend the TL for laydi because it seems that she prefers features rather than performance and the TL does seem to have a couple of more features, such as voice recognition on the navigation, bluetooth, etc."

Will they be admitted to the club?"
2051,"May 11, 2004  1:29AM",darnac,I think the Volvo may be closer than the Subaru. I am very interested in the new Legacy but it is more sport than luxury and may not even be near luxury. No steering wheel audio controls. I know the IS300 does not either. Early rumours were the Legacy would not have a remote trunk release. The ride on the GT is going to be firmer than luxury. The GT has a bunch of quality thrown at it but they did not try to hard to convey an image of luxury. They are most certainly going for the sport crowd with 250 lb/ft of torque and lightened body panels. The GT may be my next car but I am getting it for the driving dynamics and not the cush. I currently drive an 02 MB C240 which is slow but very quiet and has near luxury features.
2052,"May 11, 2004  2:03AM",cwbarrett,I have a 2002 Altima and ready to trade up. After reading these boards I took a 330IX stick for a test drive today and I don't understand all the praise. A stiff ride (all 330 have sport suspension acording to the sales guy) like that may be good for the track but it beats you up on New England roads. Yes the handling was tight but I didn't feel a strong connection with the road. The shifting was not overly smooth and it had the pickup of a 2001 Maxima. I felt the interior was very plain.  I was really disappointed.
2053,"May 11, 2004  2:42AM",shipo,"First, a correction; not all 330 sedans have the sport suspension.  The 330i has the sport suspension; the 330xi has the standard suspension.Relative to the ""stiff ride"", I guess it's all a matter of personal taste.  The suspension on the 330xi that you drove is the exact same suspension that I had on my 1999 328i, and if anything, it was too soft.  As such, I ordered the Sport Package on my next BMW, and once again, if anything, it's too soft.  Oh, and by the way, I live in New England.Regarding not feeling connected to the road, well, with the standard 205/50 R17 All-Season tires that the ""xi"" comes with, I'm not too surprised.  If you want to feel connected to the road, drive a 330i with the Sport Package (SP) or better yet, drive the 330i with the Performance Package (ZHP).  FWIW, the SP will only make a marginal compromise in the ride of the car while improving the handling considerably.  The ZHP will magnify that compromise/improvement considerably more.Regarding the interior, yes, BMWs do typically have simple and very functional interiors, some of us like them, some folks don't.  The good news is that there is plenty of competition in that segment these days and you won't have to look too much further a field to find something that suits you better.Best Regards,Shipo"
2054,"May 11, 2004  3:55AM",blueguydotcom,"Altima 2.5?  Doesn't sound like you have the 3.5 SE as that's pretty well known for having a bone jarring ride.  The interior is plain?  Those who live in glasses houses...As for harsh, huh, I find my ZHP too soft. Guess that's why they make so many brands of cars.  One man's harsh (your view of the 330i) is another man's mildly sport (my view of a standard 330i)."

2056,"May 11, 2004  1:37PM",fjm1,"CWBarrett:  I hear yah.  FWIW I echo the previous statements.  If your going in search of the ""BMW soul"" a 330ix isn't going to show you what driving enthusiasts rave about.As for ""what's all the fuss"" it can be hard to spot.  The value added quotient for BMW's lies in the details.  It takes a sharp eye to spot some of the over-engineering that goes into most BMW's.  From great paint that will last the life of the car to premium tires on many of the sport models, and seats that are an ergonomic marvel, it all adds up.Don't get me wrong, I still think they're overpriced and unreliable, but I can see, and more importantly feel, why others choose to own these fine driving machines."

2061,"May 11, 2004  5:31PM",designman,"In nearly every thread around here there is a wide tolerance for digression. It makes for stimulating uninhibited conversation. It's one thing when forum hosts get involved because this is a privately owned place and it is their prerogative, but getting tossed by another poster for questionable reasons is out of line. As far as I am concerned, if a car doesn't fall within the topic BUT COMPARES to these cars it should be discussed by default. It's only normal and natural. Furthermore, there's the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. And since this place is not a court of law, I think it would be better to adhere to the latter."

Neither are luxury cars, neither belong in a legit comparo of luxury brands.If you think there should be a bang for the buck comparo discussion based on performance cars ranging from 30-45k, open that discussion.  Then you can toss in the S2000, STi, CTS-V, M3, Mustang, etc, etc.Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans have been defined.  The Scoobie isn't one.Heck, if I wanted just performance, i'd buy a 23k WRX and mod it like my brother-in-law's bro.  He's got over 350 HP pumping through that ratty tin can econobox."

2076,"May 12, 2004  3:25PM",designman,"I've been a fan of the BMW and Porsche look, particularly the latter for 30 years. Subtle shape and details, clean lines, minimalism. To me styling is a big part of the total package. Now that BMW has gone to the fruit-cake look I will not buy another one even though they are without doubt the ultimate driving sedans. I can live with boring, but ugly crosses over my tolerance threshold. Am watching TL and RL closely. The styling is clean-cut and SH-AWD has my attention. But that's in the sedan category. Sports cars are another story. For instance, I would never buy a yellow sedan, but it works on the two seaters. So do orange, purple and chartreuse.I am also a fan of the kiddie cars aka boy racers. I know some people loathe them but I think they show energy and youthful panache. Wouldn't mind doin' up an M3 (the ultimate kiddie car) in purple with yellow and orange flames! Make that an E39 M5!!! Love ridiculous street cars.;-)"

I can get from philly to raleigh nc without stopping now.

2110,"May 24, 2004  1:16PM",chrisboth,crawfordz.com has the plenum for 395.  Kinetix makes a plastic one that has had some issues for about the same price.  Crawford takes a nissan plenum takes the top off and welds on sheet metal to make a new shape.  On the G forum I frequent with 3500 members there is an absolute consensus that this is the besst bang for buck mod out there for the VQ.  This is not a bolt on Honda Civic toy this is a fundamental change for the better breathing ability this car should have in the first place if not for the shape of the Z hood for which this iteration of the VQ is designed.  Have you bud call and chat with Doug at crawford and he'll be on board tuning like the rest of us who find that those Z nuts do all the testing and tuning work to our benefit.  This motor can easily produce 300hp without spending much cash or making a ton of noise.At ATCO raceway when 300 Z's and G's from several forums got together I raced a coupe with 20 more HP out of the showroom.  I have just the plenum and a lightweight pulley.  He got a 14.7 @ 94 in the 1/4 at 59 degrees with 39% humidity.  He has a 6 speed and lauched rather well.  I have an auto and ran a 14.2 at 97+.  Other Sedan auto's were running 15's and even a 16.

I'd be skeptical that your setup is at 300.  Close maybe, but the VQ ain't like uncorking some V8 where minor bolt-ons yield staggering #'s.I would say that 10-15 whp is a reasonable claim.  Won't catch me tinkering under the hood until the warranty expires.  260 hp is still plenty fast for me."
2112,"May 24, 2004  5:42PM",chrisboth,"I have no idea what my HP is but I doubt the plenum is worth 40 too!  How about 20 is what we G guys expect.  That plus the pulley plus a modified air intake and a grounding kit is what gets you to about 300 or so.  Hell the 350'Z weight in about 300 less than my car - they run about 14.4 stock auto with 287 hp so what does a faster heavier car have on the same track same day...your guess is as good as mine but If I were betting I'd say more than 287 baby!PS The video of this race of me vs the G coupe left the guy holding the camera audibly gasping as I pulled on the coupe.  AS my car hit second he was right there after second gear he was 5 lengths behind - and he has a six speed with 280 stock and was running a pop charger and z intake.  While not good for 40 hp - this is worthwhile beyond the $ paid for it and the results dont lie - email me and i can link you to the discussions.  The v-8 thing is true but don't let your past experience detract you from recognizing that if 2 cylinders of the six are choked for air as they are stock, that the modification will help in a significant way...again - this is not a tin can toy for a tiburon - this is an engine design mod!"
2113,"May 24, 2004  6:14PM",speedracer3,"I am assuming that by doing the mod, you have essentially voided your powertrain warranty, right?...or is this something that Nissan endorses?"
2114,"May 24, 2004  6:23PM",kdshapiro,I do not believe one can make this type change and not void the warranty.
2115,"May 24, 2004  6:41PM",chrisboth,"Endorsing is a far cry from denying warranty service.  They don't need to endorse it to be legally inclined to fix my car if something breaks and that specific mods didn't cause the problem.I've been down a long winding road of discovery since I bought this thing and I felt the same way as you about modding before.  Hell, i've owned 5 japanse cars and until now the biggst mod I ever made was putting in speakers that didn't suck...I am not into stickers or racing on the street or being seen and heard - it's about engineering, design funtionality and making the 35k I paid for my car pay off in tinkering and improvements that DONT hurt the car.  FUN!  I want to own this thing for 200k miles or 10 years which ever comes first (10 years is looking good).Why would a BETTER air intake manifold setup hurt the car? If the intake plenum itself goes then you get a new one from Doug...and the only ones to go have been covered by him even though they were all FI induced blowouts of the plenum at the weld points - yer talking 450 hp cars here!Given that you have effectively improved the car, lets hope you didn't drop any bolts or dirt into the intake runners...  IF the day you put the plenum on the car doesn't work becasue you didn't install it correctly - you're on your own.  But if you put the plenum on and there is a problem with your air flow sensor or the exhaust manifold cracks - well they would have to prove that your mod casued the problem.  Casue and effect are hard for them to come up with in the most clear cut cases.  The MM act is a good one to get to know.  It puts the burden of proof on the dealer.  Proven effective mods that dont harm the engine from reputable race teams or proven mod experts is harmless fun to me.  Is there risk - sure.  But a better design like a plenum that offers better airflow and less air fuel ratio differential for each cylinder (or more even distribution of the same air) is not going to casue you any problems (dont take my word for it call doug or think physics).  THis is no where near the modification level of a forced induction system or something that makes the engine work hotter, faster, more...this makes it work more efficiently with the existing conditions - ala the better gas mileage.Adding 40 hp tp this car is not going to hurt it one iota.  Studying the VQ for the last few months while researching the viability of lightweight underrive crank pulley I learned that the VQ may be the most naturally balanced and most durable engine ever built with 6 holes.  From the cylinder bank angle to the internal balancing to the tranny that handles 340hp in a v-8 platform from the Q...it all adds up to me no longer worrying about things that wont hurt my engine.  The worst thing I ever did was a Cold air intake and I may put that back on if my girlfriend stops driving it!"
2116,"May 24, 2004  6:43PM",speedracer3,"KD,Well, if it was done with NISMO parts and done at a Nissan sanctioned facility you would be ok.Chris,You'd be surprised how manufacturers find any excuse to strip you of your warranty. Sometimes any mod, weather related to the warranty repair or not is enough for them to deny you warranty coverage. You shouldn't have a problem with the VQ, because it is a very sturdy engine, but just in case, be prepared to fight if you go to your Infiniti dealership for warranty repair that relates to engine or tranny."
2117,"May 24, 2004  6:48PM",chrisboth,My dealer actually installed the crank pulley for me.  There has never been a case where a pulley casued a VQ motor to fail.  When i show up at the dealer the techs come running to see what I'v been working on and many are incorporating my mods into thier own maxima's and G's.  Many dealers sell the pulley and many have installed the plenum (not mine).  Some infiniti dealership will give you a hard time as they are not mod friendly...a hard time is easliy overcome with knowledge about your rights as a consumer.  I get BS from service providers all the time about things they think they cant do.   A little knowledge always overcomes ignorance and people looking for an excuse to not work or cover the warranty.
2118,"May 24, 2004  7:01PM",speedracer3,"My point was.... that if you were installing a NISMO part at your Nissan/Infiniti dealer, you have less of a chance of getting your powertrain warranty voided. A ""foreign"" part in your engine could tempt them to blackball you."

2120,"May 24, 2004  7:27PM",chrisboth,"Yer right and my points about the dealer attitude will certainly affect you getting to the desired result which is a fixed car if you didn't break it.  Look the day I went in to get my seat fixed my STOCK pulley started to squeal like a pig right in the service bay...immediatley some guy who sits at a desk (the servuce rep) said it was from my Injen CAI...I had to take the time to make him go get the real tech so he could tell both of us that it was OBVIOUSLY the pulley.  Point being - some dealers will TRY to blackball you but the ability they have to actually deny warranty service is against them and thier wishes to make things go away if they think you will because they attribute your problem to your mods.  You can walk away or you can demand your rights.  The words ""Magunson Moss Act"" during one of these freindly dealer spats turns heads and get results faster than you can say ""my car goes faster than the new 300C"".Spend some time with people who are nuts about these things like I have and the enlightenment about what you can do and have the right to do is incredible.  And lets get real - I am not doing much to my car at all so my boldness is not really that bold now is it"

The plenum helps the top end tremendously but the real power for this car is at 4500 or so and add'l redline may not help.  And PS mods to the flash programming are not detecable by the dealer PER THE DEALER and based on the fact that they never check that unless the ECU is replaced.""to see that there's yet another board in which the laws of physics and thermodynamics have been repealed.""Whose repealing physics?  The plenum helps the engine based on SIMPLE physics.  This is Homer level.  The measured airflow for the front two cylinders is not consistent with the front two or middle two by a significant measure.  ""Is the premise here that some bolt-on outfit has figured out something that the Nissan engineers either: a) were too stupid to see, or b) found, but didn't want to use, because they didn't want the engine that they use in 90% of their vehicles to have more power and/or fuel economy?""You almost got it; Engineers do not make the perfect performance car or it would have 400hp.  They make a balanced daily driver out of a Z platform with all the give and take of design, functionality, $, platform selection, engine availabilty.  Somehow those guys at nissan who do a pretty good job based on net income figured that if they were going to have a certain clearance under the hood of the Z, they would maximaize space using a sloping plenum.  As stupid as they are they still got 287 HP out of NA v-6.  Another whopping 8% in power shouldn't be so hard to believe.  20hp is alot but it doesn't change the car.  Break in is also responsible for the add;l mileage I qouted and I would attribute the plenum to a 4 mpg increase on the highway.  While the bolt on outfits may not impress you (have you been to one) the fact is these guys race weekly and know more about engineering and cars and speed and motors than you'd ever believe.  There are plenty of Z cars out there running 330 hp totally N/A.  This should be easily believable so to think that I can't get to 300 or so with $1500 in a G with the same platform and same motor give an intake tube and a minor exhaust difference.  You guys driving LS's and 3 series and TL's may have your motor on edge cominng out of the factory - mine has 30% more to give and as they release newer versions of the G they will have add'l power as well.  330 hp in the new m45 from the same VQ3.5 is probable if not foreseeable.  Tinkering is not so bad guys - 3500 members giving thorough analysis to this and many other great tweaks such as a FREE airbox mod and tons others plus the support of a hundred thousand crazy Z owners can find plenty wrong with those yucky engineers at nissan and thier crap designs.  Proof is in the pudding 15.0 or 14.2.  The difference measured in time equates to some horsepower measurement based on the weight of my car.  I wonder what that number would be?"
2126,"May 25, 2004  1:07PM",chrisboth,1)  There is no possible way a dealer will attribute a non moving part to any detontation or worst case you can dream of.  It's not that hard to make a plenum if you are an expert.  Don't be scared there are hundreds and thousands who taken the leap based on other poeple being the guinea pig.  To be clear I run NO risk for this or any mod I have chosen in terms of dealer warranty issues - this is not a twin turbo install.2)  You dont believe it because you attribute a 40% increase in mileage to what.  I say the sudden blip in mileage the day after I got the plenum speaks for itself and the 2500 others with excel spreadsheets and milage charts...sha.  What do you think better/more air does to your car - effeciency come to my mind and better gas mileage would come from that as a default.  Is your denial based on the 3 series having few mods like this?3)  I increase the reliablity by doing two things a)  lightening the load on my crank with a lite weight pulley and b) improving and eqaulizing the airflow distribution to all intake runners.I've been studying the physics on these for a while.  I dont proclaim power numbers for the sake of it without a dyno chart but you can see them from other's with the same exact mods on more enthusiastic car specific forums for yourself.  Those 2 mnods are worht 30hp.
2127,"May 25, 2004  2:53PM",kdshapiro,"""What do you think better/more air does to your car - effeciency come to my mind and better gas mileage would come from that as a default. Is your denial based on the 3 series having few mods like this?""Better performance at the expense of gas mileage. I've never seen a mod on any car that increase performance and gas mileage at the same time. If that were the case there would be a mod that increases gas mileage thorough the roof, I'm still waiting for one of them. You must be the only one that gets better performance, more pulling power and a whoppping increase in overall gas mileage. Why do you think the Subaru 2.5 engine can get an abysmal 14mpg? Yeah, it produces and it is FA, but there is a cost. There is always a cost. While your discussion at face value sounds nice, I do not buy any of it, because there is no way to measure it, only your conjecture about your interpetation. I'm not saying don't mod the car, but I do not believe any engine mod such as you did is the holy grail and in fact will not lead to warranty problems down the line. But it's okay, it's not my car, you don't have to convince me."
2128,"May 25, 2004  4:20PM",chrisboth,I wont try and convince you but i wont let other G owner be steered astray by falsities or misinformation.MOST mods that improve performance also improve gas mileage if they relate to A/F ratio increases.  If I put a plenum on my car and the air flow is better and my A/F ratio is better the effect is a more effecient car.  If you suggest that I can get 4 mpg only from my dreams then perhaps once you have some expereince in modding cars lightly you can join my dream.  If you haven;t modded a car you may not understand that air is your friend and air is free.  It contains the O2 that powers the little pistons with the help of a detonating catalyst (petrol).  The more air in the ratio the more power is extracted given a FIXED amount of fuel.I have a hard time seeing where you miss this but look at it this way.  If the A/F ratio is 10 to 1 stock and I put a mod on that gets me 12 to 1 (which most intake mods do add air!) the results are more power which = less work for the motor for the same loads and speeds = better gas milage.  Most people driving modded G's are there reporting 25-29.  Most stock ones are 17-23.  Not scientific study but not it's rocket science either.

Luxury brand remaking is good if your customers dont stress about getting it home very night.

They made the most of thier opportunity to correct the uncorrectable.  Jim Wynn in Norristown PA by the way.  In the words of the guy who handed me a check for all my money back less 200 bucks for mileage, ""Once they get a bug you can't kill it"".  He said the 7 series is the biggest electrical nightmare in germany right now as all the cool electrical modules and miles of fiber optics and 30 way headrests make it fail at almost 2% rate.Never german is my motto even as I represent my friends and family at the audi dealer in thier purchases...yes i love to negotiate and i buy cars for fun and free for them (thier money of course).  And I still give the passat thumbs up for being the best family sedan out there for the $ - as long as you get a good one...quite a caveat but I'm surprise when I tell people about my expereince how they still want the passat...great car for them...wonder what will save them now?"

If you can weld you can do this but theres no point on a BMW - the plenum is not sloped in the front!  Hell the plenum design is completely different on a straigh six.  You can add a hood scoop ram air deal like my dads duster had - go for it.  Only this car [G] as I am aware would benefit from a plenum change. Most cars already have a level plenum!  So i guess we do have a lock and key...The throttle body is fine and so is the cylinder size and design...what are you talking about.  Those things work well even with a choking plenum!No infiniti dealer will ever condone aftermarket mods.  They usually are too ignorant to understand that they have to fix the car unless they can prove the mod created the problem ...You want the answer?  Speak to my lemon attorney who deals in warranty cases on the side.  You have more rights than you give yourself credit for.  The consumer shouldn't be held down by the ignorant whims of a unknowledgable service rep or tech or dealers.  The ones I talk to will say hey great mod but not in front of thier anti-mod manager.  Obviously if a dealer comes out and says mod all you want, he'll be dealing with idoits who botch thier installs and act like nothing was even touched by them let alone modded....It's cut and dry in form but dealers will try and manhandle you.  AS with most others that try to screw me out of my money they will lose.  If you do want to talk to a dealer who is mod ornery Grubbs Infiniti acctually builds race cars and test cars and offer a full service tuner shop where you can buy NISMO and a host of aftermarket products intalled by them.  Don't be fooled by the never been there's.  My dealer never saw mods until I and subsequently a few others brought in modded G's last year.  They have been educated and will continue to be as long as the trend for getting that easily obtained 300 hp is around.I used to be skeptical too.  When I asked these questions the anwers were there for the plucking.  The anti mod attitude takes a while to get over and then you see the light.

Your case may be different but when you actually have a leg to stand on such as a lemon law.. and an attorney - things start to get way easier in my experience.  I actaully told VWOA i simply wanted a warranty that would keep me happy in the car after the 2/24000 was up and free from unlimitied repair costs for a young car.  They laughed and told me flat out no...they want you to go away and or get an attorney - they dont want to deal with an unhappy consumer.  The frim I used has pre-litigation programs with VW where they settle 20 cars at a time....but they cant give me an extended warranty.  It never even occurred to me to sue them until she laughed at me!I had a such a good set of fact in my favor the attorney i hired told me in 15 minutes I would win and the next I heard VWOA was back on the phone asking how i would like the buy back guy to obtain my car in exchange for a check.  To the point that the designers are stupid:  Look all the G had to have was enough HP to dethrone a couple of stlawart sedans from the top of the hill.  If it gets better HP or equal for that matter to the class contenders, what's the problem.  I would bet that 3.0 in your car has some more power stashed in there..it's a function of exterior design in the Z /G case...money is probably a bigger one.  Hell we could put forged internals in all the cars and bigger cams...at some point the marketers take over and say lets build the car with x horsepower and y looks and z price.  If it sells then the slanted plenum is not such a big deal...except to those of us who want the power and dont have the slanted hood of the Z.  Turn out it fits in the Z too if you take out the hood liner!No engine sold today has all the perfect design attributes...they are all filled with trade offs unless you get exotic.  This trade off was a sloped hood for 20 HP.  And it's a good move obviously since they sell Z's like candy and the engine does pretty well gettting them 1320 feet in 13.5 stock.

Nissan has varied the HP rating by applying minor tweaks to the engine or exhaust system. You are living proof that getting more juice out of the VQ can be done inexpensively in the aftermarket world as well. As we discussed, the risk is being denied warranty service if something goes wrong. Solution is either have 1)A good dealer 2) A good mechanic. As to your rant about why companies don't give you the maximum potential in your engine, go figure. My Audi 1.8T with the right chip program can generate 200hp. Why do they give a measly 170hp?..my thought, so they don't trounce their V6s."

2164,"June  9, 2004  9:37PM",jazevedo,"Hi, I don't want to discuss which car is better, but basically I like the 330i with zhp a bit better than the G35 due to interior and exterior looks(in a big way actually).  Of course the 6K or 7K difference can help the G35 seem like the way to go.  Since I really want the bmw, I need to rationalize paying the extra money.....so can anyone help me estimate the maintenance costs on the G35 during the first 4 years - I want to add that to the price of the G35 to compare to the BMW which includes maintenance.  Can I assume it is close to $2K, or will it be cheaper?If $2K, that would bring the prices within $5K of each other...still a big difference...but then again if the resale value of the BMW after 4 or 5 years is $4 or $5K above the resale value of the Infiniti....the cost to own either car would be about the same (except sales tax would be slightly higher on the bmw and interest on the higher loan)?  Am I reaching here?  Maybe I'm wrong to assume the Infiniti will lose as much $ value as the bmw over the 4-5 year period...I'm just guessing this because bmw's are so popular, I'd think it would be easier to sell.  Any comments would be appreciated."

I estimated both cars to be worth 50% of MSRP in 4 years, assuming 48K miles.  That is probably a little generous for both, but it gives you a baseline.

2167,"June 10, 2004  6:04AM",blueguydotcom,"honestly, if you like the BMW better, just go with it.  I was gungho on the G35.  KD and I used to go rounds when the G hit the street.  I was convinced it would be my next car.  I drove everything under the sun BUT a manual 330i.  They were tough to get my hands on between march and may of 2003.  The G35 with the 6 was great.  Fantastic.  But yet it didn't quite feel perfect for me.  then I drove a 330ci with manual and felt I could like that car.  The next day I got my hands on a 330i ZHP that was still covered in plastic.  I unwrapped it like a big present, took it out for one of Cunningham BMW's excellent twisty-hilly-all road types drives.  I signed for it 30 minutes later.I knew as soon as I drove the 330i ZHP that I simply would not be happy with another car.  Price be damned, you only live once.If you can negotiate it in your area, shoot for 1900 below invoice (there's a 2400 rebate on the car).  That's $500 dealer profit.  Decent.  Don't pay any bogus extra fees either.  If you can't get that where you live but you're near the west coast - email around southern cal.  There are so many dealers they're very cutthroat.  My dealership did $400 over invoice in may 2003 (and still does on 3 series cars).  With a rebate I would have been at 2k below invoice.  Buy in so cal and just hop a southwest flight out here if you can't beat the price locally."
2168,"June 10, 2004 12:17PM",chrisboth,"1200 for 4 year maintenance could be a stretch if you dont use the dealer and do some stuff yourself - air filter and cabin filter alone cost 350 or so over 4 years and you can get that to 75 or less doing it all yourself.  Oil and gas is all this thing really needs and 1 good fluid change in 60k.  There is little work involved in keeping a VQ running.  BRakes are covered for 36k no matter what invluding rotors.The BMW free service is not all that free as I understand it.  What they give you is 15k service - basically oil and filter and they ""check everything"".  My dealer is very good at this as well but they charge base service fee to check everything and change oil for 250 and all add'l labor and parts extra.  FOR A 7500 mil checkup I dont need anything but oil and washer fluid thanks.  BMW will need little hopelfully and less likely tho in those same intervals but you will be paying to change your oil 2 of 3 times unless you like burnt sludge on your internals.  Marketing is powerful - read furhter into it.  And dont forget you can mod your G save another 4 mpg add 30 hp all for 1000 bucks.  300 hp if you can turn a ratchet and 260 if not...way more fun than a 330i IMO.  WWait for the new 330 if you get one and wait for the new lineup of motors as well.  BMW isn't gouig to be 2nd for long (I guess Infiniti will respond in 07 with a G45 if I'm lucky)"

""The BMW free service is not all that free as I understand it""That is correct, they cover about 95% of the normal car maintenance. BMW will not cover tires, headliner, alignments, abuse and a few other miscellaneous items. Not sure about tranny flushes/coolant flushes. Everything else is covered in a 4 year/50K B-B warranty. Service is based on the cars service interval indicator and costs $0. They cover the fluids, microfilter, brakes/brake flush and wipers and what ever else is specified. So far in two years of ownership I've spent $0 on the car for anything. The only out of pocket was for the car alarm."

2171,"June 10, 2004  2:01PM",kyfdx,"Well.. I was trying to do an apple to apples comparison...  MOST people have their maintenance done at the dealership, at least during the warranty period.I don't think I'm far off on an Infiniti dealer charging $1200 for six maintenance visits.. every 7500 miles up to 45K.  And, if the car needs brakes, the BMW comes out even further ahead, as the BMW dealer does it for free.$2075 is still over $40/mo. more..  Not an insignificant amount, but definitely a number that you can slide by your significant other, to get the car you really want.    I tried to run all those numbers without a bias, but if I was putting hard numbers to it, I'd guess the Infiniti would depreciate more on a percentage basis, and the BMW would wear out tires faster.   So, in real life, the numbers could vary a lot one way or another.If it won't break your budget, always get what YOU want.regards,kyfdx"

I hear they make you pay for 2 oil changes in between. The depreciation of the G is the best in class of coupes and much higher residuals are offered for both versions of the G.  the 54% 3 year 12k number I got is more like 61% or so now which for 3 years is awesome.  I've heard 63% or 66% for coupes but not buying it unless I see it in person. These cars hold value equally well IMO.  People were worried 2 years ago but resales are going very well on the G front.PS why would BMW tires wear out faster?And for G brakes - they can wear out every 10k as long as the rotors don't gore out IMO.  These things rock like none other and grab like Governer Arnold.  Pads are cheap.  Especially when they are free upto 36k.  My car has 20k and they have 30% left or so.

I have a Mustang GT and I installed a K&N air filter, but that's about all I did on my own!  So if I had the G35, I'd be bringing it to the dealer for service whenever it was due.  I know a couple people with bmw's and they don't change the oil until 15K miles since it's synthetic.  Maybe some people cringe at the thought of waiting that long, but my friends haven't had any problems and I can't imagine the dealer would recommend something that could harm the car?I haven't researched depreciation - I just assumed the bmw would hold it's value a bit better since they appear to be more in demand - but that's just my perception and I could be wrong.  I see mostly g35 coupes and not so many sedans, and the dealer seemed more willing to deal than the cocky bmw dealers (I live in San Francisco bay area).The 330 zhp has 18 inch wheels, wheras the G35 sedan has 17's....so tires should wear out faster on the bmw...Blueguy - thanks, I've read your posts and you sound extremely happy with your car...maybe I'll be in your shoes soon.  But I have yet to test drive the 330 which I'd like to do soon and then test drive the G35 right after.

That said, the G35 was just new on the market at the time, maybe things have changed.I will say that I have always been surprised at how cheap my two BMWs have been to insure.

If you buy an auto the difference between the two auto's is about .8 or so difference.  All 3 series fall short or barely match (perf only) the G 1/4 mile time.  The G is more visceral and with more engine noise the ride is louder - but with 220 watts of bose you wont care unless you are like me and you like th noise.  I haven't put in a CD in 3 months and barely turn it on.  With 277 or whatever HP the G will run about 14.1 in the quarter my guess.

2191,"June 15, 2004  5:43PM",riez,"For manual transmission cars, driver skill and familiarity with the clutch & shifter will make a huge difference.  The car mag guys are paid to do this and use aggressive means.  Are you willing to turn your TC system off and drop your clutch at 3-5,000 RPMs and smoke your tires?  Few real world drivers even come close on the street.  And if they do it, they don't do it many times.Even BMW's SMG launch control will only allow so many of the most brutal launches.  Forget if the number is 5-6-7.An automatic transmission takes most of the driver skill out of it.  It is easier for the average person to get close to theoretical maximum performance since there are fewer variables and less driving skill is needed.Don't forget that gearing and final drive ratios are critical.  A huge key to best 0-60 mph time is to do it needing only 2 gears (1st and 2nd).  Time between shifts is wasted.  Too many cars require a shift to 3rd to hit 60 mph.  They'll hit the rev limiter before reaching 60 mph and you have to upshift.C&D's 5-60 mph ""street start"" time is probably the best single acceleration number for the average street driver!"

Got to have fuel to beat the class to tears.  2)  More refined ride:  NO  Is this more interior stuff because in stock 27k form the G handles better is faster than and out tractions (new term) the 330 and matches the 330 zhp.  The latest test has the G sedan with 215s at .9 skidpad and most slaloms stats have the G at >66 or so and never once second to a 330 in direct comparison.  There is nothing the 3 does better except maybe in ride quality?  Where o where is the refinement in a vehicle that is second to the leader in all performance categories.  I must have missed that when I bolted for the infiniti dealer after my 330 was 44k; and get this -no more refined than the 28K G I test drove.  In fact all the extra wheel base is more 5 series like than 3 according to the bimmer loving soon to be in laws who claw at my G all weekend.  The 3 is refined and it has the interior of a german car sure - but it can't run the road any better than a G beyond the intricacies of personal preference.   ALWAYS subjectiveness here but lets take a look at what the media has to say once in a while when they consistently dub the G the class leader.  I'm sure the new 3 will address this in spades.3)  Better precision machine:  Um NO.  What does this mean since the car is slower and handles almost as well as a G.  Does the 3 have some inbred feeling of precision that makes it feel like it can handle or acccelerate like a G when it can't...whatever it is it costs too much - WAY too much.4)  Nice looking ride:  YES you are correct.  The 3 is great looking and will prob be the best looking of the 1-7 series once refined to Bangles desires.  At least he got 1.5 of 3 right - the 5 is growing on me again!  The old 3 is a classic desing for sure - i wonder if they thought they would sell that many here - ubiquity is a sign of success.  The G is like the Cowboys - OK Blueguy - The G is like J LO - either people love her or hate her.Supercharge an M3 - Power is not lacking in an M3 but that would keep me from going far from home.  With all the problems a over stroked engine already has at 9k rpm - another 140 ft/# would be a detenation waiting to happen.  I'm a NA guy.  PS the VQ handles about 400-500 hp FI without reinforced internals.  If one had to build a car from scratch and get the most HP I know pleny of FI G's that would cause one to scratch thier head when considering a M3.  Guys with 6 pounds of boost are getting 12.5's with street tires.  Really does anyone FI an m3?  they must really turn down the boost."

And on any of those cars, if they're geared correctly, the car should be turning almost no RPMs at 60 or 30 in 6th gear.  Only an tool would attempt to punch it at 60 mph in 6th gear.  You don't buy a manual to totally be out of control of the car.  3rd gear works fine at those low speeds.  6th is for over 80.

Keep in mind that many cars don't allow you to disable or fully disable their traction control system.  In these cars, you can't achieve maximum acceleration launches.  And other cars lack the engine output to really smoke their tires no matter how high the RPMs before you drop the clutch.Unlike the aggressive-launch 0-60 mph test, the 5-60 mph test is a very good indicator of the average person's ability to reliably duplicate the test result, esp. in an automatic."

The Mercedes C class was too small, I drove an E320, which was a very comfortable size, and rode nice and smooth. It was also 58,000 as  opposed to the 43,000 of my CTS, and didn't have the acceleration that the CTS has. What really scared me off of the E class was reading the horror stories about reliabilty over on the mercedes forum.   I also checked out the Lexus...first the ES...a very quiet and refined car,  but with no pretentions to sports car handling, and the rather blah looks of a Camry, and even the LS. The LS is a beautiful automobile, with a silky smooth engine and drivetrain, but again it's styling is rather bland,and it costs 58,000.   The BMW 3 series was  a smooth refined car,but again, a bit cramped for my tastes .  The CTS fit the bill best for what I was looking for.

Many people are attacking pontiac precisely because they made the new GTO a stealth car that has no bling, that nobody watches the car pass and peers inside to see ""who is driving that?"".Looking for a car to be a head-turner is absolutely no different than painting a Civic pink, dropping it, fitting dubs and neon lights and topping it off with a big spoiler.  It's all about attention.BTW, this is one reason I prefer the old M3.  No gills.  Nothing outwardly too different on the last gen M3.  A debadged 03 M5 is the ultimate as it can stomp the hades out of most cars and it's pretty much nondescript.

True performance lasts forever.A classic, almost by definition, is a timelessly styled car that truly performs in comparison to the other cars out there.  Think of the Porsche 356 and '57 Chevy.  Or the Jaguar E-type, Corvette Stingray, and Aston Martin DB6 in the 1960s.  The BMW 1600/1800/2002 in 1960s and 1970s.  Maybe the Fiat X19 or Porsche 914/6 in the 1970s.  Audi in the 1980s.  Dodge Viper in the 1990s.  Or the various 911s for about 30 plus years.There aren't that many design classics.  Even normally beautiful exotic marques like Ferrari or Maserati have a ton of duds and mediocrities.  (Can't say too many Italian cars after the 1960s impress me.  Their exotics went down hill styling-wise in the 1970s.)Give me a conservatively styled car (possibly with a bright exterior color like red or yellow, for excitement) that is an all around performer.

2262,"June 21, 2004 11:39AM",merc1,"Very interesting discussion about styling. I initially thought the CTS was the ugliest thing to hit the road.  While the car still isn't a classically good looking car in my book, they did nail the proportions.  The only thing left to do with the next generation is to smooth out some of the harsh lines and sharp points. I don't like cars that look as though they will cut your hands if you try to feel the sheetmetal.  They may have done just that (smooth out the edges/sharpness) with the 2005 STS, but the theme may not work as well on a larger car. I'll have to see the STS in person to determine that. It is now official.  I love the look of the new Chrysler 300C.  I saw a few of these this past weekend.  Rolling in a sea of forgettable, boring car this car really stands out.  It looks like a pure gangsta car through and through.  I don't know where everyone else lives, but in the Chicago area this is the hottest car on the street right now.   Everyone one from older couples to young fill in the blank wannabes adore, desire and are buying this car.  This is bold American styling at its best.  I love it.   With a SRT-8 version coming and awd, they may keep the sales going for quite a while.   I don't have to tell you how bad Chrysler needed a ""hit"". BMW. Not sure what to say here other than that they've probably ruined one of the top 5 most recognizable design languages in all of cardom.   I still at 3 years later detest the 7-Series.  The 5-Series is little better, especially in darker colors, but it still gets smoked by the E-Class in styling.  The 6-Series if there ever was a car who's whole look was ruined by one element, that big old square [non-permissible content removed]!   BMW really better ask themselves about what they want for the 2006 3-Series.  The Acura TL comes so close to being a styling star, but no cigar.  Contrived and messy styling imo.  That character line and those side sills don't work together.   Dealers here are adding protective strips right below that charater line, creating a true mess.  Factory mud flaps, yuck.   Honda it seems is destined to style every 4-door car they make like some variation of an Accord.  Witness the 2005 RL. Giant Accord.   The TSX remains the best looking Acura, imo. I'm slightly worried about a company that seemingly could do no wrong when it came to styling, Audi.  They're going to put the new grille on everything by 2006.  Not sure about that.  I liked the new grille design on the A8L W12 but I've yet to see the new A6 and facelifted A4.  Careful.  The current A6 had no styling rival in it's class until the 2003 E appeared, imo.  The 1998-2004 was just perfect in that sense to me.  Nissan is hit or miss stylistically now.   The Maxima is a mess inside and out.  The Murano and Quest are messes inside, either cheap or just plain weird.  The Altima was good looking in 2002, but has since blended in.   Nothing tops the Passat in the family segment in styling for me.   Just a few thoughts....M"

Ever watch a butcher grind chopmeat? I can't help but picture chopmeat coming out of that grille. Also if it ever needs replacement, no problem, just pick up any highway sewer grid and bolt it on.

Suddently, a construction truck changed lanes without making any signal. The truck ran into the driver side of our 9-3. The 9-3 spinned around from the right to the left. Finally, the back of the car hit the median wall and stopped.Everyone was surprised my wife was ok at that time. The doctor from the ER asked my wife what kind of car she drove. My wife said ""A Saab"". Then the doctor said ""Oh, you should be ok. My sister-in-law got a Saab too. They are very safe"". She came home on the same day. If she were driving in a Japanese car, she probably stayed in the hospital for weeks.Although the major damages were on the drive side doors and the trunk, the insurance company decided to write off the car (maybe it's too expensive to fix the frame).

I found they are not as ""stable"" as European cars on highway speed). European cars give me better feel from and better control on the roads too.""Have you driven a TL or G35.  The japanese figured it out finally.  A g35 at 120 is much like my soon to be sis in laws BMW 530 at 120 or so.  VERY rigid and stable (of course a smooth highway is not stability check).  I'd personally take a G35 with sports suspension - hell an Altima over the new 9-3 in an accident.  The epsilon platform from GM doesn't strike me as being autobahn worthy any more than any accord.

He was damn lucky, I'd say.Doesn't really mean that Japanese cars are inherently safer than German cars. Depends more on each vehicle.

They've been collecting data on their wrecked cars in real world accidents in Europe for over 40 years and you're telling us that all of this reasearch puts them on or at the same level as companies like GM or Ford in safety.   These two in particular don't even know where to put gas tanks in their cars or trucks.   I'd really like to see your status if a C-Class or S40 gets hit by an SUV compared to a Focus or Cavalier or Civic. These lab tests are silly in the fact that they are controlled and very predictable. Since when is a real world accident predictable and controlled?  Companies like MB and Volvo were doing safety engineering before any of these US test organizations had a clue.   Amazingly now the NHTSA wants makers to address rear-end impacts and the affects it has on seats, only about 20 years after Volvo and Mercedes solved the problem.  These same safey regs give American cars that have headrests (important in a rear collision) that ""rests"" in the small of your back and don't come anywhere near protecting your actual ""head"" a ""five star"" safety rating.

It certainly gives the analyst and manufacturer something to go on as the offset high speed is one of the more devestating impacts.  Some may think its crap but I think it saves lives as it gives terrific data to the makers.

If you check into Insurance data in Europe on European cars you'll see where Volvo, Renault, Mercedes and others have proven they are safer than the majority of Japanese cars.

Second if you think real world cars aren't better because something can't be gleaned from slamming half a car into a block wall at 45 in offset fashion then you might just assume that you will only be in other more friendly kinds of accidents.  There are few more tragic impacts than head on offset frontal.  You need to know what happens at 45 which is a major impact before a car can become a protective shell at 65.  A merc c class more safer than a G or Maxima - horse puckeyActually seeing what happens in a controlled setting while the car rips apart up to the passengers knees and head is probably the reason G's may be safer than the volvo mercedes and 3 series.  I haven't seen any reason to believe I should buy into the pioneers marketing campaigns - all safety technology has been pertty reverse engineered if not shared and everyone uses everyone elses ideas...it's why there are so many great safe cars.  Buy a chrysler if that emotion stirs your decision making it was Iaccoca that demanded airbags and did major groundbreaking in his labs for the technology to come to market.The safest cars to be in are the accords and camarys based on real data.  Can someone help me remember where I read this a month or so ago? ~ It may have been related to recent press about the rollover ratings, I'll post if I find it  The article stated that a lithe sedan is way less dangerous than any suv for rolling over which is the more deadly variety of accident.  Also the drivers that buy conservative sedans may be part of the correlation.  If you really want to be safe a volvo will make you feel good before the accident thanks to the marketing but I'll not feel any safer since I know my car has more ability to avoid some accidents better than any car in class thanks to its handling edge and if impact does happen I should do as well it's compeitors."

2304,"June 24, 2004  2:09PM",r34,"I think most Japanese Cars advertised their cars to be reliability and have great value (like Toyota & Honda). Sometimes, they mentioned good safety rating but I don't think that is their main focus. For some European Manufacturers, like Volvo & Saab, they have been famous for safety (and they focus on safety a lot) for a long time. As I mentioned before, please knock on the doors on a Japanese car and then the doors on an European car (or maybe an American car too). You can tell the latter is more solid. The later usually has much more heavy doors too. Just think it simple, throw an egg and a stone (may not be that extreme but it is just an example) to the wall. Which one will have fewer damages ? I feel European cars are safety just based on my experience (I don't even want to mention the accident my mom had with her Corolla).I think most Japanese mid-size cars are safe, but no as safe as European's. For Civic and Corolla (or Tercel/Echo), I doubt you can walk out with minor injury after a highway accident. They are famous for good milage and value. I got so many friends driving small Japanese cars in Canada and US and I don't think those small cars can protect you that well in highway accident (in city they may be ok).

2308,"June 25, 2004  3:19AM",fedlawman,"There may be no true way to know if a Volvo is safer than a Honda (my V70 and TSX are both top-rated in gov't tests), but drive them back-to-back and guess which one feels more secure.Basically, I think they're both be very safe - and I feel very well protected in each of them. I do, however, place a lot of value in Volvo's history of safety research, testing, and pioneering new technologies/devices (WHIPS, SIPS, etc.) Today, as in the past, Volvo devotes a great deal of it's resources into safety research, and the result is they are typically among the first to introduce groundbreaking new safety features. Other car companies adopt this technology a couple years later and all cars on the road get safer and safer year after year.I never bought into the Volvo marketing machine either...that is, until I test drove, and ultimately purchased a Volvo.

Also a C-Class or S40 are similar in size to a Corolla or Civic.   I garuantee a C-Class or S40 will come out better than any other comparably sized car. Camrys and Accord being the safest cars is the horse puckey imo.  There is no way either of these are as safe as a mid-size or large Volvo or Mercedes or even a Saab 9-5.

""You need to know what happens at 45 which is a major impact before a car can become a protective shell at 65.""My point exactly and why would they care about a 65 mph crash if they only have to pass the test at 45.  Nissan is not a safety driven company like Volvo or Mercedes or Saab and with all the cheapining they've been doing do you really think they've thought any further about safety past government tests?  I seriously doubt it.  A crash at 45 mph is serious enough, but when you add another 20 mph to the game you're basically talking a whole new level of danger, with a corresponding level of engineering needed.

With the money saved you could look into some simple mods for the 2.4 Mazda drops into the car.  I know Mazda's owners are crazy about tinkering.  One turbo could make the 3 an insanely fun little car/hatch.

WHIPS and headlight wipers    (I though it was Volvo too)4. etc.etc...Saab was one of the first car maker to build a production turbo car successfully (I am not sure if Saab was the first one but they were among the first group).

Cars at the same price point are all about equally contented, albeit often in very different areas, and we (ought) to choose based on our wants in these areas.

I'm looking at this thread because I'd like to get a 330i with zhp.  It's not a 911, but the BMW has excellent handling and the power is nothing to sneeze at (although I'm worried it won't have enough torque, since the ""feel"" of accelerating is more imporant to me than actually getting my from point a to b the fastest...but I'll test drive soon and find out for sure).  I love fast cars, but it's simply not practical for me to have a 2 seat sports car...and I'm not rich enough yet to have a weekend Viper in addition to my lux sedan.If an auto makes you happy than that's great, but you can't say Blueguy is wrong about a stick being a lot more fun and worth the extra pain in traffic for many people."

The manuals on the G35, Altima and Max were just as bad as the one on my old Stanza.  Rubbery, vague, truckline buckets of bolts. Better than Honda anyday...not as good as Toyota. Honda has the best manuals, Nissan is not known for the manuals...yet I've heard their close-ratio six speed (in the 350Z) is a very good tranny. Wait a second, at one moment you're saying they're better than Honda, then contradicting that by mentioning Honda's trannies are the best.  What the blazes?

In an age of rising gas prices, this makes even more sense.The 325i outsells the 330i by almost 5 to 1. What would the 3 series sales be without the 2.5L option?  Apparently, the next C will have 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 engine choices as well (thanks merc1 for this info.)Of course, selling a G30 could hurt Infiniti's ""power image."" You might argue that it's not good to have a G30 while ""lesser"" Nissan sedans such as the Altima and the Maxima have larger 3.5L V6s. Then... have the 3.0L option in the Altima and Maxima as well.BMW does the same thing. They make the 525i even though the 330i exists. And the 525i sells well--almost as well as the 530i. Increase brand awareness by catering to a wider market of buyers (by offering a G30). These buyers may also trade up as they get older.  Face it, Infiniti has made great progress in the past couple years, but it still has nowhere the brand recognition of BMW, MB, or Lexus.  Of course, they should also go more ""upscale"" by concentrating on the M sedan and coupe, as well as the next Q.All the press and buzz and comparisons that BMW makes is with the 330i, yet the reality is that the 325i is their bread and butter. The G35/G30 relationship could be the same.A 230hp G30 w/ Premium Package at an MSRP of $32k ($29k street price) should get a lot of people in the door."

Some due to gearing; some due to small engine for the weight.)  I do wish Toyota/Lexus had marketed a bare-bones IS200 with 6-speed manual in USA.  Toyota sells it in Japan and Europe.

The VQ30 is a lot smoother especially in the higher RPM ranges. In terms of bringing a smaller engine size, wouldn't bother with a G30 (too close to the G35), but a G25 (Skyline 250GT) would actually be an great entry level Infiniti."
2449,"July  6, 2004  4:12PM",chrisboth,KD the steptronic is great at everything but keeping you from owning a dog when you wanted a cat.  The auto makes an otherwise very strong motor seem less enthusiastic and frankly slow.  The manual is a very nice compliment to the straight six.  The auto saps power somehow so while nice and smooth it's less than desirable to many who dont want to sacrifice performance because they live in the northeast.
2450,"July  6, 2004  5:52PM",riez,"kdshapiro...  I'm talking about both city and highway EPA estimates.  The 325i is not fuel efficient.  Of course, both a 330i and a 325i will get 0 mpg when stuck in heavy traffic and waiting at stoplights.  That is the downside to heavy urban traffic and roadway congestion.325i uses a numerically higher final drive than the 330i.  That impacts RPMs in all gears, lowering fuel economy."

2457,"July  7, 2004  2:32AM",fedlawman,"The reason the 325i sells so well compared to the 330i is because the difference in performance is less dramatic than one might expect, and the 325i is almost $5000 cheaper.That and the fact that many 325i buyers don't care about speed or performance, just the spinning propeller on the hood."

The 325i might actually be more nimble than the 330i, but the power difference feels significant, especially with the auto transmission.In a straight line, the 325i feels like a 4-cylinder Accord.  The 330i can almost keep up with the G35's and TL's out there.But apparently, most 3 series buyers would rather be in a relatively sluggish $35k vehicle, keep the $5k, and have the propeller on the hood."

That people want what they want and it seems those comments are all about jealousy.

A car cruising on the highway has the throttle at high restriction anyways, so less restriction in the intake obviously isn't going to help.

2473,"July  7, 2004  6:06PM",chrisboth,http://www.kptechnologies.net/chris/chris_race.htmProof is right here in terms of power increases anyway.  Try again with real math.  Since I wont brave using the 5 gallon reserve I fill up at E on the nose.  Let's be conservative and say that there are 4 of 20 gallons left so 440/16=27.5.  Pretty good and obviously there is better math with a fillup for actual gallons.The stock plenum is choking the front bank of cylinders for air.  A less restrictive plenum doesn't allow for more air it allows the SAME air to work more efficently by more equally sharing the airflow and distribution of that airflow.  Lots of people doubt this snakeoil plenum adds any power either and thats why enthusiasts race and test and race and test and the rest of the daisy drivers wonder and live with things the way they are.I didn't get from 15 to 14.2 in the quarter mile with twin turbos - a pulley and a plenum is all it takes.  $750 total

At low RPM's on highway drives, there is a high level of vacuum in the plenum already, and airflow is slow--nothing is going to get starved.  Even the developers of the plenum say this.  I know you unfortunately can't cope with a manual transmission, but there is a thing on the dash called a tachometer that will help you see highways RPM's.  By the way, if by getting our calculator out and concentrating you conclude that 440/20 = 23-25, then i see why we're having problems communicating.  dave"

Plenum restriction does have an impact for high RPM wide-open throttle operation.  This is normal and expected.    There are lots of dyno graphs that illustrate this--often airflow enhancement hurts power at lower RPM's.  Counterintuitive, but that's how it works.  I found some interesting g35 dyno charts with the crawford plenum, but unfortunately i can't link to them due to town hall rules.  According to them, even 15hp is optimistic.  But i'm not arguing about power, just the idea that increasing airflow is going to incrase economy.  It just doesn't work that way.  Your engine is *SUPPOSED* to be starved when cruising on the highway.  That's the point of a throttle.  A lot of people seem to assume that increasing one aspect of efficiency ( power ) is going to positively impact another aspect ( fuel economy ).  They're often different issues--but not always of course--reducing internal friction would improve both.  But thinking that anything that increases power is going to increase fuel economy is like thinking that anything that helps me run faster is also going to help me bench more.  Not necessarily, or even often, the case.  dave"

Heck, recently the steering setup on my protege feels more responsive and better than that of even my 3 series ZHP (but that's more related to those wretched, slick, pathetic Potenza S-03s).Also the substantial weight of the cars plays a role.  The most engaging car on the road that I've driven is still without a doubt the Miata.  Point and shoot.

2541,"July 16, 2004  2:54PM",fjm1,"I&#146;ve owned both a 3&#146;er sedan with sport suspension and now own a G sedan with sport suspension. I try to autocross at least once per year, finnally getting the G on the track. When I was in Germany the BMW went to Hockenheim and Nurburgring.  I will say right now that the BMW has a better balance of firmness and compliance in everyday driving.  But these are my on track observations.The BMW will hit precisely on the marks lap after lap. The BMW understeers. Slow speed corners can be a challenge because the chassis must be &#147;flicked&#148; into the corner.  By this I mean as you come into a slow (sub 30 mph) tight corner the balance of the BMW must be purposely upset to allow for better rotation of the nose.  Normally this can be done with the throttle on most rear drivers but the BMW tucks it&#146;s tail and digs during WOT corner exit.  The suspension in the BMW is better at soaking up track irregularities.  Mid corner bumps don&#146;t usually cause you to run wide or have to lift for fear of rotation.  BMW sport suspension handles multiple corners like S-curves very well.  Threshold braking is linear with zero fade.  The BMW is surgical, precise, capable and unflappable.Having said all that about the BMW the G is ultimately more capable mostly because of more power.  It takes a better driver than me to wring out everything the G has to offer. The G takes a few more course corrections. The G is easier to modulate with the throttle.  The G can be coaxed to drift easier and superior torque can make for terrifying exit speeds. I can run out of track and talent with the G&#146;s go pedal.  Tight corners can be dispatched easily with a touch of throttle-on oversteer.   Track irregularities can upset the G&#146;s chassis during threshold braking and the rear can definitely step out on fast sweepers.  The G does not transition very well during multi-corner maneuvers.   There is more bobbing as the dampers fight to control pitch and roll.  Once the G is set though it&#146;s time to dial in the throttle and ROCKET.  The G is powerful, visceral, involved, and ultimately more rewarding to drive fast.  On a road course I believe a novice driver could drive a BMW and post better times than in a G.  A skilled driver in a G would post better times than in a BMW.  For me, it would probably be a wash depending on the length of the straightaway.  Ultimately, I enjoy both cars greatly and am fortunate to have owned both and gotten to test each cars limits within a safe, controlled environment."

My family has owned at least one since 1991 so i'm pretty darn familiar with how them.  Even the original with the tiny 113 hp engine was a blast.No, I haven't driven an S2000 yet.  I will do so in April-March of 2006 when I begin the quest for the Bimmer's replacement.  Someone mentioned driving long distances and the perf package as rough...actually on long freeway drives it's pretty much like a normal 330i.  It's on surface streets that it feels more jittery."

I may get them even tho I don't track her on road courses.  People say the rigididty over bumps is improved and the sway is nill - they are adjustable so you could also tweak the balance to oversteer from under which is stock even if the tail fliks easily.You do give up some independence of the suspension but - what's a slightly harsher ride going to mean at this point anyway...apparently it's already like driving a non-sprung shoppping cart!
2545,"July 16, 2004  8:15PM",blueguydotcom,That's a killer car.  Too bad it's 40k+. That's a little steep for a car that's not even all-weather capable.  not that it rains here...
2546,"July 18, 2004 12:19AM",jazevedo,"Well I finally test drove the 330i with performance package today in 6-speed.  I had driven the G35 a few months ago, but it was an automatic so I can't compare exactly.  My initial reaction was that it wasn't as fast as I'd hoped.  I'm used to a V8 mustang and while the BMW is quicker to 60 and 1/4 mile, I think it has more to do with the higher revving engine and more consistent engine output, whereas the V8 screams at 3500 RPM's but gives up in the higher rmps.Anybody else think the G35's higher torque numbers make the car ""feel"" quicker?  I'm wondering if I'll get bored with the bmw after a year....I must admit I wasn't used to the clutch so my shifts weren't completely smooth...maybe once I get used to the car it will feel faster?  I'm not saying it felt slow, it just didn't make my hair stand up!The handling definitely was great and I like the interior much better than the G35.  And I love the looks even though BMW's are everywhere.  Just curious what others think of the acceleration feel in these cars.Thanks!"

Currently I am a resident of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).My choice is between the TL & G35 leather w/ premium pkg.(An '04 I35 w/ Nav. and cold weather pkg. for < $28k would be a third choice).Questions:(i) What are typical ""additional"" fees dealers charge in Oregon, or to Oregon residents (buying in WA, or CA, for instance)?(ii) There is no sales tax on cars, right, for OR residents?(iii) What is a good time to buy a new car- August, September, October (due to '05 models and inventory reduction etc.)?(iv) Would it be unreasonable to expect to get an '04 non- navi. TL or '04 G35 leather w/ prem. pkg. for $32k, all inclusive?(v) How well does the argument of an '04 car being ""a year old"" (and so it should be offered for lesser) usually work in Aug/ Sept/ Oct, if the dealer has some '04 models on-site?Thanks again."

Check out our Smart Shopper board.

2554,"August  2, 2004  3:15AM",Weazell,"I posted this elsewhere but I want to get some additional feedback . . .I looked today at a 2002 MB C320 Sedan. It looks like I could get it for around $25K which seems to be a dang good price, based on what I got from NADA. (Based on the VIN, they had it booked at $29,625 - Retail - and $25,775 - Trade-In.) Before I do anything nuts, I thought I'd ask a few questions . . .1. The car has 27,000 miles on it, so it still has a ways to go on the warranty. Anyone have any experience with MB dealerships on how willing they are are to honor warranty issues from second or third owners of the vehicle?2. There seem to be lots of questions about quality on this board. I know it's annoying when a quality vehicle gives you grief but it also sounds like the vehicles under warranty are getting problems fixed without too much trouble. Am I right or am I missing something?3. I gotta know more about the cell phone thing. My guess is that it will only work with a specific MB approved, cell phone provider, right? There's no way to get my US Cellular number to work with this thing is there?4. Any other advice from those of you who have bought a used MB C-Class vehicle?Thanks for your help!Peter"

2558,"August  6, 2004 12:33AM",bmbmw,"Greetings all... I have been following this board for over a year and have found the discussions both interesting and insightful. This fall I intend to purchase either a new ('05) 240 (elegance) or BMW 325i. I have only owned and driven Corolla's in the past, on average keeping them 12 years...they have only ever been great cars. In terms of reliability, they are my standard. But I'm ready to try something more upscale now and after a fair amount of research it has come down to the 2 fine cars mentioned above. I intend to keep my next car for 10 years, I will only put low(city) mileage on it, will get the extended warranty and expect to pay it off within 1 year.  My first choice (or the choice of my heart) would be the 240, but I am concerned about the recent Consumer Reports ratings of the car. I know that the 01 and 02 years are of greater concern on this. How has the reliability been for those who bought '03 and '04 model years? I guess my close 2nd choice (or the choice of my head) would be the BMW... its a little more sports sedan (I'm more of a touring sedan type myself)and it has very high ratings from most automotive sources... at any rate I would appreciate your thoughts, thank you...B"
2559,"August  6, 2004  6:12AM",m4d_cow,"most auto magazines make their reviews based on handling and performance, or at least more into the performance factor.i've heard of quite a number of people complaining about the pre-'04 C-class' seats, being uncomfy on longer trips. but i heard they fixed it since the '04 model.reliability isnt far from bmw's, which in this case, if you drive only [non-permissible content removed] cars so far, is gonna be a pain in the butt if you wanna keep it for 10 years.but even if youre more into touring the bmw is still a fine choice  just a bit less comfy than the mercedes in the ride departmentin any case id say take a test drive before you decide"
2560,"August  6, 2004  6:28AM",dhanley,"I tend to think reliability is overblown--yes, a corolla may be more reliable than either of these two cars--but it also might not be.  The reality of it is that the vast majority of cars out there, and probably all the ones in this topic, are within a statistical deviation of each other, so just buy what you like and gets you the most bang for your buck.  There's cars out there that are cool enough that i almost wish my 3-er would give me an excuse to trade it.  I really like the c-class overall; if the c230 had just a little bit more oomph...  dave"
2561,"August  6, 2004  1:01PM",billyperks,Get the C32 AMG-my friend has one and it has some oomph to it.
2562,"August  6, 2004  2:15PM",kyfdx,"From anecdotal evidence I would say the BMW will be cheaper to maintain than the Mercedes.  If you keep it for ten years, resale isn't that important, but if you do happen to get rid of it earlier, the 3-series will hold its value better than the C-class.Something that might sway you..  BMW will soon be offering manufacturer extended warranties that bump the coverage to 6yr/100K miles and you can also extend the ""free"" maintenance coverage to match that time period.  The extended warranty is $2249 and the extended maintenance plan is $995.  Except for future price increases, you can buy that coverage for the same price at any time before your original warranty and maintenance plan run out.I wouldn't discount the BMW, just because you are a ""touring"" type of person..   Just stay away from the sport package.  One of the 3-series strengths is how well it combines handling with a good ride.regards,kyfdx"
2563,"August  6, 2004 10:09PM",oneandonly1,"I purchased a 2002 C320 in December 2003, and also got a great deal.  Paid about $28k, and this one was fully loaded with the CD changer, phone cradle, heated seats, etc.  Best things was it only had 10k miles on it, couldn't believe it.1.  Service with Mercedes Benz has been great.  The car is still under warranty, and coverage has never been an issue even though I am not the original owner.  I have 20k miles on it now, and still have till 2006 or 34k more miles to go to the warranty.  And regular maintenance/oil changes/tire rotation are all free!!2.  I have taken the car in for a a few things and they have gone above and beyond:  the cupolder has chrome button marked ""push"" that was chipping, so they replaced it; instrument had a smudle so they replaced it; spare tire cover plastic handle was broke so they replaced it.  Only problem I have had is there was a whining noise when I would make a turn, and turns out it was the power steering.  They replaced the power steering pump.  Best thing is they also give you a free rental car while your car is being serviced.3. I have the phone cradle for a Motorola V60.  I was thrilled when I got the car because I already had a V60.  But then I found out that it has to be a Mercedes Benz V60.  You know, its a contract between MB and Motorola so they have to get you somehow.  I found the phone on ebay for about $200 and its been worth every penny.  I have service through Verizon, and live in CA.  Love being able to answer the phone handsfree through the radio speakers, and dial through the number pad on the radio.4.  Bottom line, I love the car.  Had it for 7 months now and don't regret buying it.  What I can recommend is that while its under warranty, take advantage of fixing any problem no matter how small.  I've always driven Hondas or Nissans, but this car is a lot of luxury in a compact affordable package."
2564,"August  6, 2004 10:34PM",Weazell,"Thanks for all the great feedback!  I just keep getting more and more excited about the prospect of owning this car.  I hope to nail things down this weekend.I've already had a great experience with MB customer service.  I called our local dealership to ask a couple of questions - including whether or not they might be able to provide me with information about the service record.  Not only were they willing to do that (even though I wouldn't be buying the car from them) but they faxed it over to me!  Although there have been about a dozen things done to the car over the last year, all were done under warranty and all but one were more cosmetic than anything else.  The one thing that looked kinda major was something labeled ""Rubber Mount, Torsion Bar.""  I'm going to give them a call to find out a bit more but I suspect it won't keep me from moving ahead with the purchase.  (Assuming I can bring the price down just a bit more.)Thanks again!"
2565,"August  7, 2004  4:04AM",jmess,"The more systems a things has the more potential for problems/issues. So Benz, BMW, and etc tend to have a lot of features and gadgets that could have issues over time. Some makers like Lexus seem to be able to get more things right the first time but is far from perfect.My uncle had to special order his corolla to get one without electric windows. He figured he would have the car for a long time and it was one less thing that could break."
2566,"August  7, 2004  1:37PM",chalkpie,"Was really interested in a TL (did the test drive, etc) until by chance I visited the local Saab dealer. They were offering a leftover 2003 9-5 Aero with every option imaginable for $32+. Color is metallic green with gray interior. Had 100 miles on it, with plastic still on the seats, etc.To make a long story short, and after a LOT of haggling, I ended up buying this car for $27,500 + tax. I test drove this car the same day as the TL, and I honestly loved both cars equally. Apples and oranges. I couldn't justify spending the extra $2,500 (minimum) to get the TL. In other words, the TL didn't blow me away to the point where I was saying ""This is the car I MUST own..."" I am on a tight budget, so this figure was ideally the amount that I wanted to spend on a car. Yes it is an '03, not an '04, but at that price I couldn't turn it down. Will pick up the car this Monday (August 6) and I hope this will be the beginning of a new long and fruitful relationship with Saab. I know I would have loved the TL as well, but for this time around I am going Swedish, not Japanese. I am trading in my '98 Eclipse GS-T with 136k miles. I will miss my little Eclipse."

2568,"August  7, 2004 10:24PM",fedlawman,"My wife and I just got back back this enjoyable event.I drove a Lexus GS430, M-B S430, Infiniti G35, Lexus IS300, BMW 330i, Lexus LS430, Acura TL, Lexus ES330.Impressions? GS430 - good power and good handling, nice but outdated interior layout/design (CD changer in glovebox, poorly designed center console/storage, etc.). This car needs to be re-styled, inside and out.S430 - nice power and surprisingly good handling for such a large car(this car really attacked the corners!). Interior was high class, but somewhat cold/uninviting with some quirky ergonomics.G35 - best drive of the bunch! Brakes very grabby (took some finesse), but wonderful power, exhaust note, and cornering. Interior layout/quality is this cars Achilles heel (it was a 2004).IS300 - not as hard edged as I remember. Light and nimble handling, decent power, yet at a disadvantage vs. competition. Interior looked and felt cramped, uninviting, and low-rent (well, my wife liked the speedometer).330i - More powerful than IS300, but softer around the edges handling and drivetrain wise (slightly more ""mush"" in the steering, suspension, and throttle response. Interior a step or two up from IS300 and G35, but still looked and felt dated and a little cheap.LS430 - The car I'd choose if I had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips. Plush, warm and inviting interior (suede headliner, big comfy seats, everything soft-touch). Nice straight-line power, but a pig in the twisties.TL - The car I'd choose if I had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips, but only had $30K to spend. Basically felt like a lower-rent LS430...nice power and plush modern interior, but soft driving dynamics.ES330 - My wife drove this one. She liked it, I didn't. A Camry dressed in Lexus clothing.Conclusions? If someone could build a $30K ish car that drives/sounds like the G35, and has the interior of the TL, they'd get my money. P.S. The longest line was for the Cadillac XLR. It's kinda ugly, but it goes like heck, sounds awesome, and corners on rails!"

I used to have a Honda Prelude w/ a power to weight ratio of 1hp to 19.3 lbs. and the 325i has a 16.3 power to weight.  I would be luggin' extra weight due to 4 people.  The Honda did just fine if you dipped into the power band a little bit.  The Honda was geared a little on the high side like the 325i (relative to their respective competitors).  I'd like to buy new and the 325i is the most I can afford.  (Mention a new 330 and just break out the drool cup...:)  I'm looking at this being a 100k car; that's why I am not looking at a used 330i.Somehow, I'd feel cheated if I spent all that money and couldn't get up the hill."

I didn't hear one word about the cars handling. To me that's the difference between people who buy Bimmers and people who don't.

She warms to a car that is handsome, comfortable, and easy to drive.This ES was a special edition and had a dark grey coloured trim in place of the usual wood. I like warm, natural colours in a luxury car (like the wood/taupe interior of the LS 430), and felt that the dark leather interior with dark trim made the interior feel drab and uninviting. She had no strong opinion on the interior, one way or the other.We both agreed that the seats, like other Toyotas we have driven, were too short (no thigh support) and hard. They were reminiscent of the uncomfortable seats we disliked in the Highlander we test drove last January.Since she was driving, I had a chance to look around the cabin more. I said it was like a Camry because the headliner material, moonroof surround trim and sliding cover, and plastic trim pieces (map lights, visor mirrors, dashboard, etc) were made of typical Camry/Accord quality, no better.I admit I would have liked it more if it had a natural wood trim, but overall, it just didn't look or feel like a $35,000 car.Re: ES/TL tweener.

If you think ES interior cheap already, I don't know which 30K can you find justified, interior wise. BTW, ES does come with more inviting interior color with real wood trim."

I have worked over 325's in the canyons of LA with an old style Legacy. I mean neutral handling feel, grip.  The US Legacy has always been a chassis in search of a motor.  The Japan and Euro spec Legacies have always been known for their driving experience."
2596,"August 17, 2004  9:24PM",kyfdx,"Yeah.. and in the '80s, you could get an AMC Reliance GTA that had more grip than a Corvette, due to its tire/wheel set-up.  Would I compare them? NO, but someone would...  Would I want one over a Corvette?  NO again.Can Boris Said outdrive me even in a Geo Metro?  Probably, but I still wouldn't buy one.regards,kyfdx(who really likes Subarus)"
2597,"August 17, 2004  9:28PM",kdshapiro,"Seriously, when I get the impression the Legacy takes over the title of the best sports sedan, I'll get it. But first, it has to dethrone the TL.I think it's great the a new Legacy can finally beat a 6 year old BMW design. Honestly, I think the upcoming twin turbo three series should just about change the equation. But I can here it now....""what about the value"""
2598,"August 17, 2004  9:38PM",buddhabman,"I am still waiting for the comparos to come.  I really like the TL, but it's match with the Legacy is coming .

The dude before owes it to himself to drive all the great choices out there of which the Legacy is one of the best. Hey, If you don't like Subie's, hey more power to you.  %-)"
2599,"August 17, 2004  9:52PM",kdshapiro,"BMW as never about 0-60. Yes the offer rockets, but it's about a balance of luxury and sportiness and driver connection with the road.Actually the ""dude"" can do what he wants. He may be like me and know his next car is either German or American. Lot's of great choices from both sides, but I'm skipping Japan this time around.If you want to convince yourself the new Legacy is a ""better"" car than the 5 series, go for it.I'll be more than happy to let you blow past me."
2600,"August 17, 2004 10:34PM",dhanley,"While i think the comparison with the 9-5 AREO makes  sense--i think the areo is a great car, comparing it and a 530to a subaru GT really doesn't work.  If we're choosing ""any"" sedean based on grip and power, carsdirect can get me a 6-speed GTO for $31,190 .  It even beats the legacy's combined 21mpg, too ( when both use stick ).  This is still ""luxury performance"" and there's more to that than 0-60 times.  dave"
2601,"August 17, 2004 10:38PM",buddhabman,"I agree, the point is not 0-60, it is driving feel, connection to the road and experience. The BMW has always excelled at the crosshairs of sportiness and luxury. You can keep on convincing yourself that no other car compares, but this new Legacy like the Acura TL and the G35 is finally doing the same.  Now comparing the Legacy to the 5 Series is a huge stretch, as admitted in the article referenced. But it just goes to point to the significance of the Legacy."
2602,"August 17, 2004 10:47PM",buddhabman,"Yes the Aero is nice(2003 Aero Wagon owner) . It needs stiffer springs to be a true canyon carver, but overall it is pretty under appreciated.  Go test drive a Legacy GT Limited. You will be surprised at the interior.  I have my disappoinments with it though. It doesn't have NAV or the OnStar that was removed.  It also needs backup sensors and HID's, although the projector beams are bright enough.  People we are talking middle class everymans, percieved luxury. There is not a whole lot of differnce in the materials of all these cars including the Subaru now.  I know the Legacy was tossed out of this discussion a while back as I campaigned for it's inclusion. So I will bow out.  I kind of feel like Stem Cell supporters at the Republican convention."
2603,"August 17, 2004 11:07PM",kdshapiro,"Okay last comment of mine. Perceived luxury there is no such thing. Perceived luxury=perceived value of house. The WRX has been compared to a $100,000 Porsche in the mags. Does that make it so? I have never heard anybody say in real life - Porsche - $70K= WRX.In order to be considered an entry level luxo, not a perceived entry level luxo, the i's have to be dotted and the t's have to be crossed. It's inside and well as outside.While magazine reviews never enter into my buying decisions, they are good for trends and informational sources.When the entry level luxo list list for sports sedans is:* BMW, Acura, Infiniti, Caddy, Subaru, Saab etc, and the Subaru comes out on top, that's when I'll note them to be given their due."

Somehow just as many pot-shots have been taken on both sides as so far the product produced.Seems like there are just as many nerves touched on one side as the other, as we all have our respective opinions. Only time will tell.

I look forward to both highline models becoming more affordable, and affordable models becoming more highline.

I find cars like the vette sort of fustrating because not only can you not use all the power, but you can hardly wind the engine up without getting arrested.

2612,"August 18, 2004  5:37PM",rickrover,"I've owned several BMW's, mostly 3 Series, most recently an 01 X5 which just went off lease.  In the past when my BMW lease was up I'd either turn it in and pick out a new one or purchase the old one - not this time.  I liked the X5, never had a problem with it but grew tired of driving an SUV type vehicle and decided a ""sport wagon"" would fit my requirements.  The 3 series is too small and due to be replaced next year, don't care for the 5 at all.I'd decided on an Audi A4 Avant Ultrasport - had one on order.Then I happened upon the Legacy GT wagon, my first test drive was an eye opener.  It reminded me of a BMW, steering, handling, power delivery, amenities, material quality, etc..  On the way home from the test drive I started doubting my perception of it - It couldn't have been that good.    When I got home the latest issue of Bimmer magazine was in my mailbox, imagine my suprise when the Bimmer editor had test driven the new Legacy GT at Laguna Seca with a bunch of other cars - here are the comments:""Driving on public roads tends to reveal less about a car's performance than driving on a fast track like Laguna Seca, but the first day's driving in the hills east of Monterey yielded at least one revelaton:The Subaru Legacy GT has become a genuine rival to the 3 Series.  Not only has Subaru made incredible strides where interior quality is concerned, but the car is fast (250 hp from its turbocharged 2.5-liter flat four) and involving.  It's a thoroughly engaging driver's car with precise, neutral handling and perfect steering.""So I wasn't going nuts after all - Took the GT wagon (manual) for another test drive, confirmed my earlier impressions, signed on the dotted line and cancelled the Audi.A month later I'm still very satisfied with my choice - waiting till 3k for the first oil change."

2618,"August 19, 2004  5:14PM",buddhabman,"Rickover - Nice to hear someone who has driven a BMW 3 series does appreciate that the Subarus have greatly improved. Since 1999, the US version Legacy has always been a chassis in search of a motor. They finally refined the whole package. So now I am lobbying again for the Subaru Legacy GT Limited for inclusion in this topic. This is what Edmunds editors say: ""The Bottom Line: Now a legitimate entrant in the entry-level luxury category, the new Legacy will change how people view the Subaru brand.""  But I also think the Volvo S60/V70 R Types should be included. They fall in the same price range and luxury content range."

Pontiac bonneville, GTO, loaded camries and accords, etc.  I drive a 3 series, and have looked at the subies, and while i have liked some aspect of them i haven't others: really cheap interiors, poor gas mileage, and boomy construction.

They can add 5-10K worth of wool, leather, aluminum, alcantra, Momo, Sparco, Nakamichi NAV, Mcintosh stereos whatever. Very few would buy it at the start, so it's not worth the investment.  Subaru is building the brand towards more luxury. Yes, I have driven both and yes the M3 is super nice, and way better looking IMHO.  But if you really had to make a run for your life in a car I would put my butt in a STi. ;-)Will Subaru ever have a full size luxury car, I doubt it.  They will have a larger model than the Legacy, and it will probably have alot of luxury.  The crucial car for Subaru now is the new 7-Pass Halifax or Tribeca. That car has to come correct with alot of premium/luxury features and performance. Will they put all the bells and whistles in, I don't know? Can they hell yes. There is a 450HP Subaru motor waiting for a car."

Is it a luxurious watch? Of course. Does it matter to the purchaser? Depends on the purchaser or the ultimate user.Would a Rolex afficionado look at a Timex? No.I'll admit even if Hyundai comes out with a car that meets all the above criteria I would still never buy one even if they are more reliable/luxurious.Everyone has they're biases towards certain brands correctly or incorrectly.This is why the ""luxury"" brands have to tread carefully if they decide to move downmarket e.g. BMW 1 series,separating Ford from Volvo/Jaguar.In Canada we have the Acura EL which is a gussied up Civic.So if we rebadge a car and all the cars in the lineup meet a minimum luxury level then we have a ""luxury brand"".Good or bad that's what we have."

But when you say the M3-20K is NE to STi, you are intimating that it would still be better than the STi. That is an opinion I beleive to be false, and hard to justify. The STi can up the level of interior materials, to the current Legacy standard, plus other extras like NAV and still be under the optioned out price of a 330i. It boggles my mind what Subaru  could do with an extra 20K on a STi. Not to mention what an STi Legacy will be like.        My position is that if you add 20K to the STi despite it's detriment in dimensions, the M3 wouldn't be competitive as a small Luxury compact GT. And I mean it' wouldn't be competitive in luxury and God knows it' wouldn't in performance. Now do I beleive the current STi is better.  I beleive it is better fun for the purpose of all out driving.  However, if I were single, would I rather hit the town in a STi or a M3 Convertible.

Let me tell you something, there are some people who are turned on by performance and don't need or want what is typically known as ""luxury"". It doesn't seem like this is your profile so I don't expect you to understand this. When a performance driver gets going, the only things that matter are go, stop, turn the thrill of the roller coaster. Stereos, fit n' finish, leather all this stuff doesn't mean squat. To this kind of driver these Subies deliver some serious bang for the buck&#151;performance for a HELLUVA lot less. To get the performance of both WRX and STi in a BMW you HAVE to go to the 330 perf pack/M3 respectively and dish out the cash. On the ""luxury"" aspect I've said this elsewhere. Some people classify luxury by way of butt-pampering characteristics. The thrill seeking driver sees naked performance as a luxury in itself. This is why people are willing to pay ransom's for Porsches that historically have had interiors on the level of military Jeeps. Does this disqualify Porsches as luxury cars? Not in my book. Do ""econobox"" characteristics detract from performance? It merely puts it into the dubious ""entry-level"" category. Keep denying this.Now kd, I have to ask you, have YOU driven the cars in question?

Others want the leather and trim.I could have easily got the EVO or STi as could all of us. But that is not in our target frame of reference, or else we'd all be on the Subie board, telling everyone our lastest conquer with our Sti.There is no one better car. Car manufacturers design goals include a number compromises, your purchasing goals want to minimize the compromises or trade-offs and maximize the priorities. Aspects might include finances, looks, luxury, reliability, dealer service, gas mileage etc. So you can't really say car a is better then car b in an absolute sense.This is not about BMW vs the world.

Significant body roll and understeer greatly reduces the fun factor for me, but it is a car I might recommend as a comfortable family hauler.The Volvo S60R/V70R, however, is in a different class altogether.  Faster, way more stable, feels lighter, much more agile, very fun to drive.  In addition, the exterior and interior aesthetic design, as well as the quality of the interior materials (particularly the leather), are in another league."

If it hadn't been for the narrow seats (my problem with a cracked spine) I would have plumped for it.For the record we also owned a 325 and currently have a C320.

The interiors are great,  for these 2 models they are equal to the A4 / A6 Audis and better than the corresponding BMW and MB sedans. I like these cars and the XC90 although I will probably never buy a Volvo due to the crappy treatment I got from a dealer in Santa Monica a few years back. I might eat my words when the XC90 with V8 comes out. I do question the lighter feel and nimbler handling perception versus the Legacy. The Legacy is lighter by 300 lbs. They are way stable though and track turns well but nimble is not in Volvo DNA.  The steering feel in a Legacy is more precise IMHO. Good brakes are standard for Volvo though. Comparing to the Benz or BMW in the price range for snow duty I would get the Volvo.     Comparing it to the Legacy GT, if you got the extra dough the Volvo is awesome."
2677,"September 15, 2004  1:24PM",r34,"I think Volvo did something good to have S60R and the new S40 (esp T5).For the other Swedan car maker, Saab, they need to work harder. Many people think that their technology is outdated and the 9-3 interior not not good. Well, I looked at the 2006 A4 report in Edmunds yesterday. It mentioned that Audi added twin balance shafts that spin at twice the engine speed to A4 to minimize vibration. ""Balance shafts"" ? Sounds familiar. I checked both my 2001 9-3 & 9-5 owner's manuals and found that both cars were equipped with 2 balance shafts at that time. I am not sure when Saab put those in their cars.I remembered I asked an Audi Salesperson whether the auto tranny of an A4 can learn the driver's driving style (adaptive transmission ??) and he told me no. I think Saab has some nice and unique features that they didn't mention to people. Not that many people know Saab came up the idea of headlight wipers, heated seats, etc. The Marketing dept should be responsible for that.Now 9-3 is more mainsteam. Maybe most people like it better than the old one. I missed the hatch. It needs something more than 210hp. Saab should create something like the Viggen with AWD for the 9-3 (I heard there will be a 9-3 sport hatch but AWD may not be an option)."
2678,"September 16, 2004  5:06AM",dhanley,"Hmm--that was how i felt about the '900 i used to have.  That car had lots of great features with a few glaring oversights/shortcomings.  I also had the BMW then, which had fewer ""gee, neat"" features and less utility ( hatch, interior room ) but no real shortcomings i cared about.  For example, the BMW engine didn't have that hammer-you-into the seat torque blast, with that cool motorcycle sound, but it didn't have the turbo lag either.  The saab was sort of a headache and i chose to keep the BMW but i miss that car in general.I recently seriously considered getting either a 9-3 or a 9-5.  I really like them both but each had something that made me say ""wait"" although i was contemplating pulling the trigger in each case, once with a 9-5 aero ( used, 3000 miles ) and the other time with a new ARC.  Both manual transmission.  The 9-5's bane was handling/turbo lag and the 9-3's was the el cheapo GM interior.  Both could be fixed, of course.  I think simply sticking the ecotec in the 9-5 would improve it a lot; it's a lighter smaller engine ( for better weight distribution) with less turbo lag.  The ecotec is also smoother.  Another thing that irked me is the nature of the turbo with stick.   You have to shift really fast or boost is largely lost between shifts.  It's find if you're driving ""all out"" but not so great for maneuvers in traffic.  Sort of the opposite of the GTO my cousin wants me to get.     Even with my BMW i can start moving without using the gas, just easing in the clutch, while i felt quite choppy in both the saabs when starting off.  The lack of the hatch also miffed me.  Still, I'd rather have a car i really like with a few bugs than a car that is mostly ""reliable.""  Kind of like dating the awesome girl with a few issues vs miss boring.  And there's something about the saab that i at least want to like.  The new s40 really intrigues me.  It seems to have impressive environmental credentials, which i know a lot of you probably don't care about that much so i'll shut up about that.  dave"
2679,"September 16, 2004  8:37AM",m4d_cow,"saab 9-3 isnt bad actually, ive driven one and id say its equal to volvos in handling, im not a fan of hatchbacks so i surely wont miss it  the only problem is im kinda concerned about the reliability...the new S40 is a great handler, better than any other volvos, seems like its time for them to start competing w/ the germans.but the problem is its unusually shaped, its skinny/narrow and tall  and the leather seats are overly firm for my taste."

I'm not to crazy about the looks in and out, but this car has so much to offer that I will consider buying it anyway. It performs just as good and in many cases better than cars discussed on this board (handling on the same page as 330 with performance package) and at the same time if you switch suspension to comfort it's as soft as a lexus.

2685,"September 18, 2004  3:35PM",bmbmw,"Hi All;I am getting close to making a decision on the above cars. I had the 325i for a test drive of 2 days and must say it is very nice. I found its over all ride and handling superb. I will test drive the 240 (Elegance, here in Winnipeg, Canada) next. I would like your thoughts and feed back on a few things...What are you impressions of the upgrades to the '05 240? I think they are great and long over due, esp in the case of the CD player. To me they really enhance the quality/appearance of the interior. What options have you purchased and would purchase again, and which would you not get again? I intend to keep my options (esp electronic) to a minimum as I find the models well equipped and the less electronics (IMO) the better.I have found the stereo on my 14 year old toyota very good. I am not an audiophile, so would I notice or appreciate an upgraded sound system on either of these cars? I don't expect the standard system to be excellent, but is is at least ""Good""?I have to say I find the exterior of the BMW very appealing over that of the MB, but the interior of the MB has the BMW beat. I love the comfortable sumptuousness of the MB interior.My travel needs are modest. I will only put low city miles on it, will get the extended warranty, will ""baby"" it, and hope to keep it for 8 - 10 years.While I think and feel both cars are excellent ( I find both engines more that adequate for my driving needs) I am inclined towards the 240. However my biggest reservation comes from concerns over MB quality. I understand it is not what it has been. I also understand that they are intentional about addressing this issue. I also read the the C class was early on plagued with ""bugs"". This was esp true in the 2001 and possible 2002 model years. Can I assume that most of these C class ""bugs"" have been addressed? What has been the experience of those who own 2002/03/04 vehicles? I dont expect a MB to be a good as a Japanese car, but I do expect it to be reasonably good and to hold its value over the long term.I appreciate your thoughts...thanks.B"
2686,"September 19, 2004  8:13AM",m4d_cow,"if youre gonna take good care of it, both cars should last quite long with only minor problems.reliability, like you said, will never beat japanese brands, but quite good overall, with MB being a bit more reliable in my case. 2005 MBs have new interior and seats, since a lot of people complained about the seats hurting their back on long trips.Sound systems in both cars are quite good if youre not an audiophile, it has decent sound quality.options id choose will always include xenon headlights (a must), wood trim (now std in bmws), and leather. i usually opt for premium package, but since you choose to skip the electronics, you might not need it afterallhope it helps"
2687,"September 20, 2004  4:45PM",eman6628,"If I were still living in Winnipeg and consider getting a RWD car, I would first consider the ground clearance, the more the better (I think the 240 has more clearance than the 325), then the next factor is winter tires options for the cars considered. All season tires are not very safe for winter driving in a city like Winnipeg and especially if you are going to baby it. I would consider looking at the 4matic and the xi too. Just my 2 cents."
2688,"September 24, 2004  2:36PM",gordonwd,"I&#146;ve had my &#146;04 325i for about 5 months now, so I feel qualified to evaluate it and compare it to my previous car, a &#146;98 Audi A4 1.8T. These cars are similarly equipped, manual trans, non-sport package with all-seasons, about the same size and performance category, so a comparison seems fair at this point.ENGINE &#150; Well, the 325 is rated at 35hp over the A4, so it&#146;s pretty much no contest. The engine is also smoother and really begs to be revved. The Audi would spool up pretty well, too, but I always felt like I was straining it a bit. I am also not sorry to lose the turbo, as I have always felt they add complexity under the hood that could be a long-term problem. In fact, the only major repair that I had to pay for on the A4 was a $500+ turbo-related issue.TRANSMISSION &#150; Pretty even here with both being 5-speeds. The Audi had a bit softer of a clutch vs. the BMW&#146;s abruptness. I am only now at the point where I can consistently make a really smooth 1-2 shift.HANDLING &#150; This is my first RWD car in many years, and I forgot how different it feels. The crisp turn-in is especially noticeable, and the steering overall has better feel than the A4. Ride-wise, the cars are pretty comparable: well controlled, firm but never harsh over rough pavement, typically German. The one thing the A4 had going for it was of course the Quattro AWD. One of my favorite things to do (you&#146;re never too old to be immature) was to out-drag someone at a stoplight on wet pavement. I could pretty well mash the pedal to the floor coming out and the car would just GO, leaving the other guy spinning his front (or rear) wheels. Even with traction control on a RWD or FWD, you&#146;re not going to beat AWD in slippery conditions.INTERIOR &#150; Audi is known for interior design and the A4 did have very nice styling and controls layout. The BMW is not as well coordinated, but is a bit more business-like in its appearance. However, I like my particular color combination better than the A4&#146;s. The sand leatherette along with black floormats and dash, set off by the premium wood trim, makes for a nice look as opposed to the A4 that was all gray with some silver trim pieces. The leatherette in the BMW is also a bit nicer-appearing than the A4&#146;s.The automatic climate control on the BMW is not quite as good at regulating temperature and air movement as the Audi&#146;s. The fan seems to blow too high in some conditions and not fast enough in others. The Audi definitely had the best auto-temp control that I have experienced.EXTERIOR &#150; At the time that I picked out my A4, it was the E36 that I compared it against and I thought the A4 was better looking. But ever since the E46 came out the next year, my eye was always drawn to them when I spied one. I still think, though, that the A4 has classic good looks that I prefer to the newer model that was released in &#146;01. Likewise I expect that I will still prefer the E46 after the E90 comes out.RADIO &#150; No contest here: the Audi had a much superior standard radio. On a few occasions, I&#146;ve wondered if the CDs that I&#146;m playing in the BMW are the same ones that I used to play in the A4.INTANGIBLES &#150; I am not a status seeker, but from the reaction of many people that I know I can see that the BMW nameplate carries a lot more prestige than most others. Everyone knows what a BMW is, whereas I think that Audi is less known and tends to get lumped with other second-tier European cars. There is something about seeing that roundel on the steering wheel that makes me feel extra good about my choice.SUMUP &#150; The 325i feels like a small performance sedan with luxury appointments and options; the A4 is more of a small luxury sedan that performs well. And there you have it (my opinion of course)."

2693,"October 18, 2004  8:03PM",jamesspot,"First off, hats off to Lexus for such a high class event and willingness to set up their 9 cars and 2 competitors in each category for the public to drive on a closed course. I went Saturday morning to FEDEX Field's (Redskin stadium) parking lot. There was a quick registration, orientation, Lexus autoshow display, cooking demo, kid's corner, a great buffet lunch, and golf pros to work with your swing, but the main event was driving on three different courses: luxury, performance, and SUV. I drove 10 of 27 different cars in 3 hours. All were automatics, traction control was required to remain engaged, and the rule was do not exceed the car's or your ability.My notes on the cars of interest to this forum:Lexus IS300: Underpowered six compared to the BMW and G35 with a transmission that had longer shift delays. Competent handling and decent brakes, but tended to understeer at the limit, leading me to plow one hard corner. Racy interior with easy to use controls. A ""good value"" choice if price and reliability are your top concerns in this segment. The car for my younger brother.Infiniti G35: POWER! Oh, baby, this one has an engine. The interior was not as bad to drive as others would lead you to believe, but the handling is beneath the balance of the BMW and the Lexus. This is a car that makes the average driver (me) look bad. Saved by ABS and the traction control system from a potentially scary rear end spin. G35 owners have a reasonably priced, family-sized car with V8-like power, but you can only put it down on the track if you really know what you are doing. The car for a coworker who drag races on the weekends and takes four to lunch during the week.Acura TL: If I were picking a car for my wife, sister, real estate agent, etc., this would be the one. Beautiful, jewel-like interior with state-of-the-art sound and ALL the features at a decent price. Plenty of power for the street. It just doesn't handle like a sport sedan with front wheel drive.Mercedes C320: Softer ride, less-powerful engine, smooth transmission, nice interior. Others do different parts better at lower price points. Nice car, but nothing special for the money, pass. If you got the bucks and want the star, think AMG.BMW 330i: OK, I'm biased, but this car makes the average driver look good with an ideal balance of engine, transmission, handling, and braking in a driver-oriented interior. Drove a premium packaged car with steptronic. Moving the shifter inboard to Sport and touching the DSC once (I didn't turn it off iaw the ""rules""), and the car performs: powerful acceleration (outmatched only by the G35), quick redline shifts that were the best, great brakes, and incredibly BALANCED handling. I was foot to the floor, threshold braking, hands spinnning the wheel, and having the time of my life. Much faster car for me because of the control available. The standard 330i is under tired (get the sport package for the performance tires, sport seats, and steering wheel). The steptronic (evaluated in ""S"" mode) was much better than I expected. Give me a little more power, more tire, and a manual - oh, that's my ZHP. I was still amazed at what a standard 330i can do, driven much harder than I've ever driven my car, which I have yet to track."
2694,"October 18, 2004  9:17PM",riez,"jamesspot...  What were the MSRPs for the respective vehicles?  Too bad they were all automatics.  (Amazes me that Lexus didn't use the 325ia.  325i outsells the 330i by about a factor of 3-to-1.  325i prices out, with similar options like an IS300.  A decently optioned 330i can quickly push $40,000.  Did the IS300 have optional LSD and VSC?)"
2695,"October 19, 2004  1:32AM",jamesspot,"We just went from car to car. They had info posters highlighting the specs of each of the automobiles. Lexus was amazingly fair in their presentation of all the cars. The class groupings had the IS300 with the G35 and the 330i, the ES330 (which I didn't drive) was grouped with the C320 and the TL.The G35 and IS300 are low 30's cars, while a 330i step with premium package and the C320 are pushing 40k.The IS300 did have traction control, I didn't know whether it had LSD or not.I agree - the 325i is an even match for the IS300 price wise, the 330i is a much more expensive and capable car.Since the event was for the general public invited by Lexus marketing, automatics were the only game in town for every car there. I think I was invited as I went to the Lexus web site and a dealership when I was looking at cars in the Spring. It did make me want to drive my car on the course!"
2696,"October 19, 2004  4:01AM",dhanley,"I was recently at the ""autoshow in motion"" run by GM.  It was pretty similar; in luxury cars there were all the saabs(9-2,9-3,9-5), the CTS, c320, TL, 325i, and the 530.  I thought the TL really plowed dissapointingly much in turns.  Even my buddy, who's a huge honda fan, didn't like it.  I think the TSX is significantly more fun.  OTOH, the TL compares quite well with the c320.The CTS is allright, i just think the interior needs to be upgraded, and it definitely needs the sport package.  Same with the 9-3.  I may be biased, but even my honda-loving GM mechanic buddy liked the 2 bmw's the best.  The 530 with the sport package was simply phenomenal.  But that's off-topic.  I also had a chance to drive the s40 t5 AWD.  I really like the design, cabin, and volvo's environmental focus.  I think it's a pretty good car, aside from fairly significant turbo lag.  Oddly, it seems to me to have more lag with it's 2.5L than saab's almost-as-powerful 2.0L.  It also still feels like a FWD car even with AWD.  So, pretty nice, but not quite as sporty as i like.  I like that you can get a ""high end"" car without leather and wood, neither of which i really care for.  I think i'll end up waiting to test the new 3-series before i order anything.  And by then saab will have the 270hp turbo v6. Well, driving different cars is fun!dave"

TL is not the same car as TSX, but 325 does not have the same engine as 330's either. Maybe you can compare TL with 330 and TSX with 325. But the 'smaller' 325 actually sells a lot more than the more powerful 330, opposite to TL vs. TSX or ES vs. IS. There's no easy way to really match up."

Their average dealer moves few CTSs each month.Acura dealers are moving a ton of cars per month!!!  Same for Lexus!

Make the same chassis/look for a 'model' but then equip them with a wide range of engines in terms of power and config. Lexus/acura/infinity, on the other hand, go by one model-one engine approach. There's nothing wrong either way, but they do present a matching difficulty in comparison. I think people do cross shop 325/330 against TSX and TL, or IS and ES, both."
2716,"November  7, 2004  2:03PM",riez,"igiban...  Not sure I agree too much with you when you write, ""I think people do cross shop 325/330 against TSX and TL, or IS and ES, both.""I can see reasonably informed rational buyers comparing FWDers like TL, TSX (the Euro-Accord), and ES to each other, but find it hard to see them comparing a RWD car, say a 330i or IS300, to a FWD car, like the ES330 or TSX.  One drive in each will tell you how dramatically different are the two cars.Marques that use one platform to compete across a broad market segment or many segments usually rely on lots of options, including engines, and available AWD.  The 3 Series is somewhat unique in that it also includes station wagon, convertible, coupe, and M.Lexus chooses to use two entirely different platforms.  Infiniti used to until they dropped the I35, now relying on the G35 with its AWD and coupe versions to compete broadly.  But it does cost more to develop and market two entirely different platforms, esp. when one (the ES) handily outsells the other (the IS)."
2717,"November  7, 2004  2:22PM",kdshapiro,People cross shop anything. What they cross shop has no bearing on how sales numbers are presented. Sure you can say Acura sells more TLs than BMW sells 330is. But that doesn't tell any picture. Even the sales numbers don't say anything. By the sales numbers BMW should have canned the 330i a long time ago.

Didn't take me 5 minutes to figure out they were entirely two different cars with two different missions.  When I looked at Infiniti a few years ago, I drove a G35 and an I35.  Difference between night and day.  Of course, I do realize that most buyers worry more about things like stereo systems, cupholders, and wood trim than they do driving dynamics.My focus on this board is on performance, not luxury.

Drawing anything more from the above out of my words then you might be reading too sensitively. Relax.As to whether people cross shop RWD cars to FWD cars, I think so. I am not saying everyone does that or it's right or wrong either way. From what I know many, admittedly perhaps mass average drivers, are flexible in terms of getting a FWD or RWD car, esp. in Cal. It's one of the factors, but often not the most important one, unless climate dictates. Even people who buy RWD cars, like many of my bimmer friends, admit they don't tell much difference on their day to day driving between their bimmers and, say their old Hondas. Well, maybe they'd not spend the $extra$ to get a bimmer as they can't fully appreciate the extra capability, but then, they might have gotten a bimmer for reasons other than just RWD."

Should I go for a new entry level luxury sedan ?I am trying to keep the price in the mid 30's.  For the new entry level I have really not narrowed it down much.  I have read some of the posts and heard great things about the new Acura TL, the Infiniti GX 35,  the BMW 325ix, and the Saab 9-5.I think based on the posts I have eliminated the Lexus 330 and the Subie.

One can say ""I got  my IS for it's performance and not luxury', but I don't think it would be true statement, because IS is a Lexus and if you buying one you must care a grate deal about luxury. As for me if TL was RWD I would already be driving one, it does not mean I would not buy one. I like G as well but driving dynamics of RWD and slightly better performance did not win over much better looking TL(in my mind), quality of the interior and slick MT.

It's FAST!!! some torque steering, interior is great, comfortable, tons of standard features. but it depreciates more than a BMW and MBZ and it's still a Japanese car.

Torque steer isn't only tied to HP.  The small displacement 4-cyl in the TSX has little torque, esp. down low, and has to be wrapped to very high RPMs in order to generate HP.

In conclusion, the larger the gap between the MSRP and the selling price, the less depreciation you will have to pay (assume that the residual are the same).I've done some research when i lease my C230K, i can get $399 plus tax ($0 down) on a C230K w/ MSRP of $34000, while i have to pay around $20 more ($0 down) per month for a TL w/ MSRP of around $32900. Not to mention that the MBCC charge more on the interest.It's a given that the reliability of German car is always a ?, that's why i lease the MBZ so that i don't need to worry about reliability issue and i did have 4 toyotas before (still having a 03 4runner and i have to admit that Japanese cars  are problem free)I am sorry but i shouldn't have made the ""still  a Japanese car"" comment, yes, you can feel it when u r sitting inside a MBZ or BMW or even a VW, (did own a 1999 VW golf before) may be it's my personal bias.

I'd personally love a G35 coupe 6-speed. That would be too perfect. But, this car also has to be my commuter and I drive > 75 miles/day.  Also, I live around DC so I can't get by for a couple weeks with RWD only. So, this makes the TL my first choice.  Trust me, I'd love to have AWD or even RWD, but it's just not really a suitable choice.  FWD does have its drawbacks, but I think it'll serve my purposes well.I'm going to go ahead and check out the 2005 G35 too...they supposedly improved the leather, among other things.Otherwise, I can't really think of any other choices at this point!

If FWD makes you feel more comfortable then don't let us stop you, but dismissing a modern traction controlled, LSD equipped, RWD vehicle because of some snow in February is hooey."

My main concern is just the sheer distance I have to drive in the snow. I'm still under the impression that RWD, even with snow tires and traction control, is still not good on snow. My neighbors all have 325i's, G35's, M3s, and E-classes. The majority have advised NOT driving on snow in RWD, even with snows...mostly because they couldn't make it up the hill to get out of my 'hood. (it's a big one).oh well.

I have over 20 years of FWD driving under my belt in addition to my 15 years of RWD driving (most of it in snow country), and of our current three cars (2-FWD & 1-RWD), I'll choose the BMW over the other two when it comes to any trip in the snow, short or long.  In my case, I live 40 miles or so north of Boston, however, I have clients down in the NYC area and make the trip at least once a month (some months are more like 4 trips), and unless I have some specific reason (like taking the kids who like to watch movies while on long trips), it'll be the 530i every time.FWIW, I used to be a FWD/AWD bigot; that is until I put winter tires on my car in 2002.  Prior to that, I was convinced that RWD simply required too much work to drive safely in the slippery stuff.  When I did finally break down and get the winter tires, I was simply astounded at the difference.  That car is now (by far) the easiest car to drive in the snow that I have ever driven.Best Regards,Shipo"

By sheer distance I am calculating risk based on law of averages, % risk, and variable road conditions.For example, I could make it one mile up the road in my Audi with Z-rated summer tires. however, I would NEVER drive any further since odds dictate that my minimal traction would  eventually  cause me to lose control and crash. Anyways, I'm way off topic now. Just glad to hear RWD is usable in snow since I'm currently an AWD/FWD bigot.Now that you mention that, I might be heading to the Infiniti dealer to get a nice G35 coupe 6-speed. That car is amazing.

2786,"November 13, 2004  3:39PM",riez,"No matter what you drive (AWD, 4WD, FWD, RWD), your car will benefit from using dedicated snow tires.  One reason the more driving-serious Europeans drive about 75% summer/winter tires vs only 25% all-season tires.  Percentages reversed in USA.  Is fascinating that so many Americans will spend $30-50K on a sport sedan but then drive on mediocre all-season tires.  All that separates you and the road is a small contact patch of rubber.  Buy the best tires.  That means dedicated summer (really 3-season) tires and dedicated winter tires.Key to safe winter driving is driving skill.  Traction is reduced.  Modify your driving habits. Select the right gear.  Apply the throttle differently.  Take things slower.Nothing used to bring a bigger smile to my face more in winter than driving my RWD '97 Camaro with snow tires and seeing all the SUVs in the ditch during a snow storm because their foolish driver thought they were invulnerable to winter conditions.  They would barrel past me on interstate at 70 mph while I'm doing 55 mph.  Then down road I pass 'em while they dig out of a snow bank."

In the end, I had to move back up north, I missed winter too much and weekend visits up to Mammoth just didn't give me enough of a fix.  ;-)Regarding UP hill in a RWD car, yes, I believe that depending upon the situation it is easier, assuming you can maintain enough momentum to keep the front wheels rolling fast enough to allow you enough steerage to correct for the resultant fish-tailing.  Yikes, what a sentence (my Mom was an english teacher).  :-/  That said, of all the cars that I've ever owned, my hill climbing champ was indeed a car setup in the FWD configuration, my 1982 Audi 4000.  Talk about low-tech FWD!  How on earth could that have been my best climber?  Simple, in reverse.  ;-)  I was on my way to an assignation which included an almost empty rental ski condo, a hot fire and good food and wine, up in Boyne City, MI and all that stood between me and Valhalla was a VERY steep, slippery, snow and ice covered dirt road.  After several attempts to climb the hill nose first, I sat at the bottom for a few minutes and thought about the situation logically.  I popped it in reverse, and climbed that hill with absolutely no problem.When I pulled up in front of the condo she came out and asked, ""How in the hell did you get your car up here?  I needed to park in town and bum a ride from somebody with a Jeep.""I don't think I ever actually confessed to her that I did it in reverse.  ;-)Best Regards,Shipo"

2795,"November 13, 2004  9:47PM",designman,"Alright, I have to throw in two cents to keep this place honest.I used to live in 10,000 feet up in the Colorado Rockies. At first I was intimidated by the thought of snow storms and compromises with mobility. Then I quickly realized that the snow crews are nothing like NYC areas where you sometimes have to wait a day to have roads cleared. In dem dere mountains snow barely had a chance to touch the ground before they would clear the roads (the more populated areas anyway). My brother lived in Montreal and it&#146;s pretty much the same way. So it seems to me that one&#146;s daily conditions play a role when considering winter driving equipment. If you can whisk your way onto clear roads and highway, the risk of getting marooned is considerably lower.  I often find myself on lots of hills with plenty of deep stuff and/or ice. I know a thing or two about getting by with two wheels, but nothing beats AWD in snow&#151;nothing. Never even came close to having a snag. You have to use more skill and savvy with the others, like taking circuitous routes home, maintaining momentum into a hill or driving uphill backwards. Not many people would think of these things. I agree that all-season tires are not the way to go with RWD and FWD. They have mostly summer-tire characteristics and I would only use them with AWD. Even then, they compromise traction, braking and handling in snow.Bottom line here. Driving in snow with RWD and FWD is like jogging with Florsheim wingtips. Sure, you can do it. But a G35x, 325xi or anything else like this is a great choice.   Shipo, your Mom should be proud of you&#151;I see nothing wrong with that sentence. I would imagine however that she wouldn&#146;t approve of your 100 mph jaunts ;-) You CA people must me TOTALLY bored with this stuff. Questiondoes Santa Claus go to places like San Diego? Indeed, I envy you."

2798,"November 14, 2004 12:23AM",shipo,"Hmmm, I gotta disagree with you about some if this.  I regularly drive two FWD cars and one RWD car shod with winter tires, and I think that there is little comparison, the RWD car seems to have significantly better traction in all driving regimens.  So, based upon that, I would suggest a slight change to your chart for traction (I assume we are only talking about acceleration here):1) AWD w/Winter Tires2) AWD w/All-Season Tires*3) RWD w/Winter Tires*4) FWD w/Winter Tires5) FWD w/All-Season Tires6) RWD w/All-Season Tires* I'm not completely convinced that the AWD car with All-Seasons would be of any advantage over the RWD car with winter tires.Then again there are the issues of handling and braking, and if I remember the results of the side-by-side test performed by an auto magazine several years ago using cars as nearly matched as possible (MB E320 4-Matic, MB E320 RWD, Audi A6 Quattro, Audi A6 FWD) the results shifted more in favor of the Winter tire shod RWD car.  In fact, if I'm not mistaken, in the braking department, the RWD car easily won due to its inherently more neutral front/rear weight distribution (especially compared to the FWD A6) combined with its (relatively) lighter weight (compared to the two AWD cars).Personally, I am willing to give up some ""go power"" to gain some ""stop power"", hence my comment that I believe that a RWD car (especially one with a near neutral weight distribution) shod with winter tires offers the best driving experience for winter driving.  That said, if I lived in a mountainous area such as the Rockies, I would certainly opt for the AWD car simply because on a steep enough hill, the FWD/RWD car simply ain't gonna start moving from a standing stop while the AWD car will move away from the stop with relative aplomb.  ;-)Best Regards,Shipo"

Not so much the sedan (its looks aren't the best, IMO), but the coupe. I will admit that driving a RWD coupe/sedan is just a completely different experience from a FWD. In this case, different is much better. The handling, acceleration, and braking are all a world better. I am aware of the G35x, but I was really hoping to get the 6-speed. Of course, the wife wandered over to the FX35 and I knew it was all over. Fortunately, this is MY car so there's a chance that I will win this battle. The dealer had some '05 G35x's in stock, but I didn't get a chance to see one or drive one. The interior is supposed to be up in quality now vs. the 04's. Unfortunately, the 6-speed won't be around until late January or February...and I need a car NOW since mine is totalled. Thanks for all the comments on winter tires and such. I'm paying cash for the car anyways, so I might as well just take $1000 and get a quality set of winter tires. Then I can run summer/winters and have it all.

I've had four AWDs with three different AWD/4WD systems, and everyone of them had better traction (go power) with all-seasons than any 2WD car I've driven with winter tires, including my current one..And although I would rather have RWD/winters than FWD/winters for the overall handling experience (stop/turn/go power), if I am considering only traction (go power), I still have to go with the FWD.  I will grant that the type of car makes a difference though..    A large car with a long wheelbase loses some of the traction advantage that FWD provides, by moving more of the weight off the front wheels..  My old '82 Accord hatchback with 63-64% of the weight over the front wheels would leave any RWD car spinning its wheels...

2819,"November 26, 2004 12:40AM",cdost1,"Thanks for the reply.  Right before I saw your response I punched up the 330xi.  Looks like that would be a more fair compartor vs the TL and G35x.  It looks, though like it will be north of what I am willing to spend.I am going to go back and drive all 3 again and try to decide. Thanks for your help."
2820,"November 26, 2004 12:55AM",cdost1,Thanks for your response.I am curious about your comment on the low quality materials on the G35x.  Would you be able to elaborate a bit ?This car for me is about being fun to drive. Our other car is a 2004 Acura MDX which acts as family wagon.  I need the practicality of a sedan but beyond that I want something that will perform well and be a fun ride and age well.  My boss has a 325 and says it drives with 100k miles like it was new. I have had great luck with 3 Nissan's so just when I was about to eliminate the G35x I decided to keep it in the mix.Thanks again for your insight
2821,"November 26, 2004  2:44AM",brew99,"I went through a similar decision last year and ended up with the TL.  Not sure how much snow you get where you are but the front wheel drive of the TL handles the white stuff quite well.  The car is definitely fun to drive and the AT version does not have any real torque steer to be concerned with.  I reaaly liked the performance characteristics of the G35 but could not warm up to the interior.  The 330 was a little out of my price range and the general small interior size of the 3 series also did not work for me.  All 3 are great vehicles however, enjoy the decision making process."
2822,"November 26, 2004  2:29PM",cdost1,"Brew,Thanks much.  Just when I think I am leaning in one direction I get a note like yours and I am back to undecided.  I think the 330 is going to be out of my range also but I figured I would at least check it out.  As far as the snow goes I am in Northern NJ so some winters are real bad some not so much. Need the FWD or AWD for piece of mind though.  I have RWD SUV now and I buying this car because the SUV is a tobaggan in the snow.One question.  I have read in another forum about a problem with vibration on the TL at highway speeds 55 - 60 mph.  Have you had any experience with this ?Again thanks for the counsel.Cdost1"

2824,"November 27, 2004  4:04PM",kdshapiro,FWIW - I've made it through the last 3 winters with all-seasons on my 3 series. Traction control does wonders. The only snow I couldn't make it through are those uplowed roads where the snow was higher than the bumper. HTH.

I just picked up my G35X and have only driven about 50 miles so far, but am liking it more and more.  This is my first new car, and I agonized/obsessed for months over decision of which to buy. As we have an eleven year old and drive to Ohio two or three times a year, a sedan with a somewhat roomy interior was mandated. I was loving the Saab 9-5 Aero, but only with large incentives would I go for a car that stickered for 43K. I liked the Saab MPG, but turbo lag bites. Saab also had no rear or curtain airbags. Volvo S-80 was also expensive, had the airbags, but the interior and trunk seemed smallish and was down on power. M-B, Audi & BMW 3 were too expensive. A friend has the 330 Xi, and wonders if her thirteen year old will fit much longer...I hated the BMW 5, anyway.  So, here I am. AWD is fine with me; I may be able to finally forego winter tires. I'm across the river in Westchester, btw. Coming from a '94 Accord LX, the Inf. seems plenty lux for me!. The mpg should even be better for you coming from an suv. I probably paid a little more than I should have, but the ""buying experience"" was ok. Ramsey Inf. had some good quotes; try the website. Good luck, and let us know what happens."

Still agonizing so I think I am going to have my wife drive the cars as well and come up with a consensus although I will have veto power !! (My car - she just got her car a 2004 Acura MDX)  My understanding there is a seperate forum to discuss price and buying experience.  If you would not mind it would be great to know what you paid.  Also I got the impression you bought a 2004.  Is that the case ?  I have some price information from Edmunds on the 2005 but not the 2004.  I suspect I will probably buy the car in NJ at one of the 2 local dealers down by me (Summit and Denville) unless somebody knocked me out with a deal.  Based on your comments that seems unlikely.  Thanks for all of your comments.  I may go out today and narrow it down some more.  (Probably down to the BMW and GX with a slight chance on the TL.)

I have the 300C, 3's, G35, ES and TL in my list.  300C is off the list because I wasnt impressed by it's handling, front grill and interior, but boy the car was really flying. I guess its time  to move up to a real entry luxury performance class    Test drove the ES, everything is perfect except for acceleration, speed and handling. And I guess this one is also off my list.    Now I'm leaning towards the last 3 cars. I would have taken the TL off my list after reading some comments, but I decided not to (not yet).  I havent test driven the car, no so crazy about it. Too many of them on the street.    Having said that, I did some research on the new TL on all car related websites, NHTSA and many others. I'm quite surprised that ES'04 has more trans failures than all those 3's, followed by 3's, G35   and TL'04. (I couldnt find any about trans failure on TL'04, is this for real?  but more on BMW3'04, G35'04 and especially the ES'04)    I'm going to test drive the G35 this afternoon and 330/325 later on. I'm hoping that G35 is the one. I love that sexy looking car.    One question though, I read some post that the G35X is not as fast as the G35 and I also heard the 6MT has problems with it's transmission. According to some, Infiniti just hasnt issued a recall unless more people complain.  Is there any other things that I should look at (I understand that the interior is probably the cheapest among the other 3 but I can live with that)?     Thanks, darren"
2872,"December 28, 2004  7:32PM",riez,"darrenw...  If you are looking at BMW 325i or 330i AND you looked at the Lexus ES330, you should consider the Lexus IS300.  Both 325i and IS300 are RWD and similar in size.    The IS300 has consistently scored well with Consumer Reports, JD Powers, and Intellichoice.  And its crash test results for NHTSA and IIHS have been very good.  Lexus has better standard warranty though BMW has ""free"" maintenance.  Believe Lexus' extended warranty is much less expensive than BMW's."
2873,"December 29, 2004  4:13AM",cdost1,"Folks,  Saw all the posts.  I will try to answer them as succintly as possible.    I eliminated the the TL pretty quickly.  Liked the drive not that crazy about the look.  (I just bought an MDX two months ago.)  First on my quotes.  The best I could do on the 325xi in NJ was 36,299.  On the 330xi 40,299.  These quotes included Premium Pkg, Leather, upgraded stereo auto transmission, wood trim.  The quotes came from 2 different dealers JMK (325xi) Flemington (330xi).  I don't think the mats are typically included in the BMW pricing but I did not really haggle here since I ended up purchasing a G35x.  After driving all 3 cars I decided on the Infiniti.  I think I liked the tighter handling of the BMW but the 325xi just seemed way underpowered compared to a G35x.  This just was my feel.  I am sure a BMW loyalist would argue I don't know what I am talking about but that is what it felt like to me.  The 330xi would have been great.  More power than the 325xi and tighter than the G35x but I could not rationalize the additional $6500 in price for a car with less backseat and room with a 3 year old.   I saw the posts on the RWD and really cannot comment since I wanted an AWD and only drove them. Again speed and power seemed relative and a RWD was not in the decision set.  The G35x felt nice to me. (My last 2 cars were Maximas)  It handled nicely and had plenty of pep.  Believe it or not it seemed to run quieter than the 325xi as well.    The last thing is I have had 3 Nissan's and none of them owed me anything when I gave them up (All with 8 - 10 years and 150k+ miles).  That was the final factor.  I am picking it up tomorrow and assuming I do not jerked around at the last minute my 2005 G35x will cost $34,250 with Premium C Pkg, Full Size Spare and Wood Trim. The only thing not in here is TT&L.  Splash guards are not available at the moment on the 2005 G35x.  I hopes this helps everyone.  If I have any surprises I will chime back in.  Regards, Craig"

How long do they last(brakes)?  Is there any way to improve the ride on the car? road and engine noise, vibration and stiff suspension.    But everything else was perfect, except for interior and audio which I dont really care so much.   I loved its handling and imo its one of the best looking cars.  I told my wife, that I didnt want to go to any other place but she insisted to go to a BMW dealership.  Apparently she didnt like the ride. Well...tough luck charlie, I just didnt want to upset her.    Went to a Bimmer dealership, and test drove a 325i.   The car was too small for us and wasnt powerful enough compared to the G35 although it rode slightly better than the G, tighter handling and better interior/audio. I guess 325 is out of the picture.  Anyway I decided to test drive the 330i. It felt more powerful than the 325 but not the G35.   Has anyone noticed the wind noise, tougher ride/vibration (slightly better than the G), and somehow weak? power steering? or was it just that car?  The car was smaller and a lot more expensive.    I understand that sporty ride means stiffer suspension, I just wish my wife does too    I wanted to go back to the Infiniti dealership again. A funny thing happened, the salesman was upset when I asked about his opinion on Acura TL. Have to admit, it made me curious.    Riez, thanks for the suggestion but I think the IS is too small for us. but I'm sure its a good car.    Tommorow I need to go to another G35 and Acura dealership. Hope I can get it before the year end,  some said its the best time to buy a car!    Thanks for the info cdost1, greatly appreciated, I might go with the rwd.   Is it true that the cars MPG is not that good? how bad can it be?   Anyway have a good time and enjoy your new car, buddy!    m4d_cow, Eventhough I'm almost convinced that I'll go with the G35 but it doesnt hurt to test drive the TL. Have to buy it by friday.  (Unless the TL has less vibration/ wind noise/ engine noise, handle as good as the G/3's, faster than 330, better MPG and softer ride)     Thanks for your help."
2875,"December 30, 2004  4:43AM",fedlawman,"My opinion of the TL is that, using your references, it handles significantly better than the ES330, but it's not as sharp as the G35.     On the other hand, the TL rides significantly better than the G35, but it's not as creamy as the ES330.    It may turn out to be the perfect sport/comfort mix you're looking for - plus, it's interior materials and layout are a couple notches above the G35."
2876,"December 30, 2004  4:57AM",fedlawman,"Just in case anyone was wondering, here's an update on my TSX relationship...  Yes I still enjoy the car very much. However, in spite of the fact that it's made Car and Driver's ""Ten Best List"" for two straight years now, my initial impressions are proving to be true.  After 18 months of ownership, the thrill is starting to fade. Yes, I know - it has a gorgeous cockpit, peppy acceleration, and nimble handling, but like all Honda's...it's lack of ""soul"" is beginning to take it's toll on me.  I might start modding it (summer tires, rear sway bar, coil-overs, I-H-E) to make it sportier and add some personality, or I may finally get serious about leaving this segment behind (do I really want to be here?) and replace it with something more sporting and less luxurious.  A '95ish Porsche 911, a '98ish BMW M3, or perhaps a brand-new Mitsubishi Evo RS - they're all on my mind. Any thoughts/opinions?"

Plus, you don't have to get on it to go really fast. The Vette engine has always been noted for getting excellent gas mileage for such a powerful engine.  I've seen plenty of reports on TH of G35's getting bad gas mileage, but I haven't seen that argument as much of a reason not to buy it.  Plus, the performance difference between a G35 and a CTS-V is significant, to put it mildly.  ""A friend of mine bought a $50K used Porsche on-line, after his experience, I would never do something like that.""  This is a dealer, not some guy selling online. I bought my Miata by finding it online, then going to the dealer, who was a couple of hundred miles away. Full factory warranty (4 years/50K miles)would be in effect as well.  I certainly wouldn't be fearful of a car with 851 miles on it."
2883,"December 30, 2004  5:19PM",kdshapiro,"Not to voice an opinion to the contrary but gas mileage estimates mean nothing. A friend of mine drives a Vette in the same traffic pattern I do. 15mpg average mileage. Yeah they get good mileage going downhill with a tail-wind in the right traffic conditions.    But otoh it's only 1 mpg less than the estimates.

It had been a Ford executive car and owned by 2 dealerships - driven by them, but not sold. No problem, bought the car and other than it having a broken roof latch header when I got it (fixed under warranty, which still had a few months to go), it's been perfect.  So, I've got no problem with doing this kind of deal, especially when you get $10K off before negotiations start and you're going to get almost all of the factory warranty."

TLs ride and comfort are practically the best among the 3 choices  id have chosen the tl when i bought my car if only it doesnt have that annoying torque steer, and im not crazy about the looks for sure. the 330s ride is harsher cos its equipped w/ sport suspension (standard on all 330is), though sadly the gs ride is still harsher compared to bmws w/ sport suspension.  so if you can sacrifice a little handling the TL is totally worth it.  designman: 911 cabrio or targa is my dream car, ive been working hard and was so close to getting one of those until my car crashed"

2887,"December 30, 2004  7:50PM",indydriver,"I spent some significant time behind the wheel of an '85 911 (I know, that was a long time ago), and was totally unimpressed. The suspension was shockingly soft, allowing major body roll, dive and lift depending on which pedal you were pressing. Also had the bizarre floor mounted pedals. This was still in the days of ""drop-throttle oversteer"". I was amazed that this was considered a premium enthusiast's car."

Before you laugh, this was the RWD coupe with the MR2 engine, 1.8 liters, 7500 redline with perfectly neutral handling. It would never oversteer or understeer, just develop a nice, controlled four wheel drift as grip went away. Very reassuring handling. Taught me the value of neutral handling and RWD."

Honestly though, I've never warmed to the e36 - which brings me full-circle back to an e30...which has a surprising amount in common with the TSX (size, stance, attitude, acceleration, tossability, etc.).    Hell, I should probably stop fooling myself.

And if you prefer a little sporting character with your lux, all three Japanese premium brands had superior styling, quality, content and value. Euros have the hardware if you want to pay a $5-$10k premium. What is even more surprising is looking down market for a mainstream 4-door sedan. It is incredible how out-to-lunch the domestics are.

Most CTS aren't anywhere near that much. And there are obviously a large number of people like their sports sedans not to beat them up.  It's also a bigger car... many people also appreciate the space it offers.  The 3.6 is underpowered only in some alternate universe. 255 hp and 252 lb/ft of torque on regular gas.  ""Then you have to look at it. 300C beats Caddy at their own game for $5-$7K less.""  Have you driven one? I have. The 300C is not nearly as good as an all around vehicle. Fast in a straight line, sure. But throw in some corners and there's lots of body roll and tire squeal. Caddys don't do any of that.  300C lacks the chassis composure to be a sports sedan.... it's a fast cruiser.  ""And if you prefer a little sporting character with your lux, all three Japanese premium brands had superior styling""  In your opinion.

Given that Lexus does next to nothing to promote either and that BOTH are in the last MY of their current platform, I'd say sales are absolutely amazingly good!    IS300 sedan holding up compared to BMW 330i sedan.  And the GS competes against a different class of cars:  E-class, A6, and 5 Series.   If you add up all the Lexus sedan sales--ES, GS, and IS--Lexus dealers are happy.

Just because Lexus doesn't offer 2 engine choices in their car or the option of AWD does not justify limiting 3-series sales to one option.    Less than 7K cars is quite pitiful, IMHO.  Toyota decided to kill the Celica after it sold more than double that number in 2003.  So why kill a car with 15k sales and keep one with 7k?  I'm not arguing as to WHY it suffers in sales, just that it does."

I think the only way the TL was better is that its interior quality was somewhat better.  Aside from that, the CTS handled better, was more spacious, and the engine felt better ( quieter, smoother, less peaky ).    The CTS stickers for a smidge less than the TL and you can surely get a bigger discount on it."
2919,"January  5, 2005  8:40PM",qbrozen,"unfortunately, that ""smidge"" cheaper CTS is lacking in content compared to the TL.  Add in the $8K 1SC package and you've just blown the TL's price out of the water."

2921,"January  5, 2005  9:44PM",darrenw,"I just got my G35. Am happy and very excited!!    Md4cow was right. The TL had all the stuff that we all wanted (better ride, powerful yet quiet, smooth engine, good handling, good mpg, interior, tons of features).

My family just cant handle the ride.    Imo the TL is more like a handsome, muscular looking car while the G is more to the sweet and exotic type. Eventhough the TL rode & turned as flat as the G, but I do believe there's a hair difference somewhere.  The salesman was with me so I didnt have a chance to feel the torque steer.

Even had it out in some wet snow tonight and it was fine.  I found that all of the cars in the mix you were looking at did not have such great MPG.  If you are talking about these high powered engines I suspect this has something to do with it.  It looks to me that I will be getting somewhere around 325 to 350 miles on a tank with all the city driving I do.  Not much different than Explorer my Infiniti replaced.  The only reason I nixed the TL was just looks.  It drove nice and actually had a few more features for less money since it was FWD vs AWD.      Hope you found the car you wanted.  Regards, CDOST"
2923,"January  6, 2005  2:41PM",qbrozen,"well, it has little to do with what I want.  It has to do with comparing comparable cars.  Don't get me wrong, I think its great that someone can buy a stripped CTS if they want, but that doesn't mean its comparable to the TL."
2924,"January  6, 2005  2:53PM",eaton53,"""but that doesn't mean its comparable to the TL.""  Sorry, but because of it's inherently flawed FWD design, no TL is superior to a CTS, no matter how many gadgets you pile onto it.  Proper sports sedans are driven by the rear wheels, or with RWD based AWD. For some reason, Acura hasn't figured this out when everyone else has."

The G is too small, 325 is too small, the A4 is too small, the 9-3 has gotten terrible reviews.  It appears that the CTS is just as big as the TL.  I understand that the fit and finish is not as good in the CTS.  I like the exterior styling of the CTS.  One problem is that the Acura dealer is 60 miles away and the Cadillac dealer is 2 miles away.  That is a big deal to me.  I also am feeling pretty patriotic these days and am leaning to the CTS, a car i would of never looked at a year ago.  It really is tough.  On paper the Acura wins and on the interior the Acura wins.  I prefer the Caddy exterior to the TL exterior.    The Acura is cheaper on MSRP as well, but I am wondering if the street price of the CTS is probably much less than the MSRP.  It has to be.  So, a $38k CTS probably costs you $32k or so is what I am thinking.  Does anyone here know?  I am looking to lease, not buy so that changes things a little bit."

Too bad I found this out after buying my TL, which other than the tires is a great car:  smooth, quiet, powerful and handsome inside and out.    I've not been stranded (we're getting another 8-10"" on top of the 30"" of snow we got in Boston this weekend!) nor spun, but I think that is a combination of my snow driving experience and the TLs traction electronics (TC, VSA, ABS).  I'm somewhat upset with these tires (I think they flatspot, also)."
2970,"January 26, 2005 11:29PM",dhanley,"I had a chance to drive the TL and CTS back to back on a track, and in that environment, the CTS did much better.  And, you can get a LOT off the MSRP.  I recall seeing ads in the paper offering 6K off to begin with.    Now, as a daily driver, that's not the #1 criteria, but i'm not interested in a car that doesn't make me smile.  That's just my own personal preference.  OTOH this is a sport sedan topic."
2971,"January 27, 2005  2:47AM",billykrebs,"I drove the CTS today for the first time.  Love the exterior, the trunk, the size, the seats and the drive characteristics.  Cannot stand the interior.  I cannot believe it is on the inside of a $43k car that I looked at.  I thought that the dimmer switch next to the sunroof opener was going to fall off when I touched it.  The doors are plastic, the dash is plastic, the console is plastic, the knobs are plastic, the middle console is plastic.  For as much as I love the exterior I can't believe the inside is that bad.  I am really dissapointed.  I really thought that the reviews were exaggerating how bad it is.  I am sorry to those CTS owners that I am offending but I truly am surprised and disappointed.    I am the only that was that shocked by the interior.  How on earth did the CTS beat the 530, A6, Jag, E320 in the Road and Track comparison of the 6 cylinders?"
2972,"January 27, 2005  5:11AM",darrenw,"I do not own any of these vehicle, but IMO 3.xL CTS is not likely to be my choice of vehicles. TL wins the look, interior, power, reliability , comfort, ... well almost everything. If only TL comes with RWD  (but it handles pretty well too -imo)  The G otoh has better handling (imo based on its RWD setup) but it comes with tougher ride. Well, it depends on your priorities thou. But if you choose a RWDer, dont forget to get winter tires (if you live in snow area). Believe me you wont regret it.  Good luck."

I really felt like I was in a  $20k Chevy, not a (gasp) $40k Caddy!    As I said earlier, the actual driving is probably (since I haven't driven one) the CTS saving grace.  The exterior, while it has grown on me and isn't Aztek-ugly, still is too overdone for my tastes."

They are virtually identical, except I hit my head in the rear of the TL and not the G. IMO with the updated '05 G35 interior, you should definitely test drive it with your choices. It is fun to test or own any of the cars in this class. So Enjoy!"
2977,"February  2, 2005  5:00PM",jrock65,"I think a G25 priced about $2500 less than the G35 would be a good idea. Get more younger buyers in the door who will later upgrade to more expensive Infinitis.    All the other import luxury brands offer or will offer a base version offering about 200 hp. I see no reason why Infiniti should not.    Audi: A4 1.8  BMW: 325i  Mercedes: C240  Lexus: IS250 (coming soon)  Acura: TSX    They could use the V6 VQ25DE used in the Japanese Fuga (U.S. M) 250GT, making 210hp at 6000rpm, and 197 torque at 4400rpm.    Obviously, it won't feel as powerful as the G35, but it will have a lighter steering feel, better balance, and be more gas efficient as well.    It'll probably do 0-60 in about 7.0 seconds with auto trans, which won't be that bad."

I don't necessarily think that the interior is that much different.  I am only 6'1"" but I do prefer the upright position and my head/hair was rubbing on the roof of the G35, but not on the roof of the TL or the S60 for that matter.  They are all fun you are right.

2980,"February  7, 2005  5:30PM",gordonwd,"I agree that full snows are the ultimate solution, but Tirerack is in business to sell tires and would like to convince you that your all-seasons will not do the job. So far this year, my area (near Detroit) has had much more snow than in the previous 5 or 6 years, and I have been doing just fine in my 325i (RWD) with all-seasons. And that's with my local govt. having a budget problem so that it takes them several days to get around to plowing my subdivision's streets. The traction and stability controls help a lot, but in general I am very pleased with the way this car gets through the snow. Not quite as good as my previous A4 Quattro of course, but certainly adequate for this area."
2981,"February  7, 2005  5:35PM",kyfdx,"Good point..  What some people, who are not from the midwest don't realize.. is the topography changes dramatically, once you get north of I-70 (basically an east-west line that goes through Indianapolis and Columbus).      South of that line, the topography is very hilly, and even though this area gets less snow, it is much more difficult to navigate slick areas..   North of that line, most of the area is flat as a billiard table.. and, unless the snow is drifting, it really isn't that hard to navigate..     There are lots of exceptions, but I hope this helps explain why people in Detroit or Chicago might not need snows, but people in Cincinnati might require them.    regards,  kyfdx"

The issue gets a little murkier if the car has summer tires, for me, I'd get the snows.  I've spent the last dozen years on the east coast, and given the hilly nature of the local topology, winter tires become even more important.  I survived with All-Season rubber in the NYC metro area, however, there were a number of days where I needed to be on the roads, and those tires made for a serious white knuckle trip.  The winter tires I'm currently running have made such a dramatic transformation in the drivability of my car that I doubt seriously if I'll ever not opt for winter tires again.  Best Regards, Shipo"
2983,"February  7, 2005  7:17PM",laurasdada,"Greetings from the land of the newest dynasty, New England!    Ultimately, you are correct.  However, as a life-long New Englander and skier (Vermont primarily, but now that I'm in Boston, Maine and New Hampster too), I've always done just fine with front-wheel drive, all-season tires and a bit of winter driving common sense.  This is one reason I've stuck with FWD and never felt the need for AWD.  That's why I'm so disappointed with the Bridgestones' performance in the snow, I may need to buy snow tires!  If I knew I was going to need snows, I may have gone RWD.    The TCS/VSA & ABS have kept me going in the desired direction, so I'm not going to spring for snows (or better rated in the snow all seasons) yet.  See how I do the rest of this winter."
2984,"February  7, 2005  9:01PM",joeshan,".02 from the Big Apple. I was actually out in Columbus, Oh. just after Christmas and had no problems with the RS-A's even in water on top of ice (G35X).  Back here in NYC, I had no real problems in our recent ""blizzard"". The only time I was wishing for winter tires was when I was trying to park, or leave my parking space. I just turned on Snow Mode and turned off the VDC. A lot of rocking back and forth was required.   I realize that all-season tires are at best a compromise. The AWD is best for getting going and helps in turns, but AWD doesn't do anything for stopping in the snow.   I wish that the Infiniti wheels were not so expensive, as I would have a dedicated set of winter tires in the original size. I'd prefer Pirelli Sotto Zero or Dunlops, as I feel that they would last longer than Blizzaks. Too bad Nokkia or Gislaved don't make winter tires in this size."

For me, it came down to the TL and the G35. The TL has a nicer interior overall and a kick a$$ stereo. I found that the G35 had more lateral space in the back, just for your info. In my humble opinion, the G35 is a superior performance car than the TL. It corners better and has a higher pick up rate. The big draw back of the TL, for me, was the FWD; it just couldn't match the cornering of the G35. Oh...did I mention the acceleration rate of the G35?!?! If you want the overall luxury and some performance, go with the TL. If you want some luxury, but alot of fun factor, the G35 is the way to go. I recommend the sports suspension pkg too. Make sure that when you test drive these cars, that you max perform them. Good luck and have fun!"
2989,"February 21, 2005  4:59AM",hox,Thanks for the insight. The G35 is a great car.  The problem I have reading up on the G35 is gas mileage.  It seems to get aroud 15-18 mpg versus 25-28 mpg for the TL. I wonder where the Subaru would come in at gas mileage.  I have heard the turbo can get close to 25 mpg on the highway and that's a 250 hp engine.
2990,"February 21, 2005  5:14AM",jrock65,"The real world gas mileage difference between the G and the TL isn't nearly that much.  The TL gets about 22 mpg on average, and the G gets about 20 mpg."

2993,"February 22, 2005 10:43PM",ljwalters1,"I haven't driven the Subaru, but I know that of those 3, the Acura TL has a much nicer interior.  The G35 has a metal face covering the center controls (radio/a/c/etc) and it looks really tacky, fake and cheap.  My in-laws have one and complain that the metal scratches pretty easily, too.I'd think the TL would be the slowest off-the-line b/c of the low-end torque, but, frankly, it's plenty-fast for me.  With the manual, the clutch engages really early, so that might help (not sure).  Overall, they're all fast.  Since I don't live near an Autobahn-type road, the TL was the clear winner b/c of the luxury features.  TL also got the best crash-test ratings, and I think consumer reports ranks it higher than the others.As an aside, if you are even just considering navigation, go with the Acura and get it.  The system is amazing - totally integrated with a/c and radio, so you can do a lot w/o taking your eyes off the road or hands off the wheel.  Plus, if you know the phone number of your destination, you can program a route without your hands leaving the wheel.  You can also use it instead of calling ""info"" - type in the store you want and it's name, address and phone # come up so you can call them.  It's fantastic.

Also Road & Track picking the Legacy GT over the Acura TSX, can there be some reconsideration of adding the Subaru Legacy GT to this discussion.  The size is about equal to the TL or the G35.  The performance of the Legacy GT is equal or better. Safety measures & crash tests findings are equal. Quality fit & finish & interior materials are  equal IMHO; that is subjective I understand, but they are much better than the last generation. I think it warrants new consideration.

Engine's got crazy power - pulls like a damn rocket sled. Car still feels lumbering and not very agile even with optional 18s. you sit far too high up so the feeling of speed is more apparent than in the bmw and it ends up making the car feel more like a souped up, decent handling buick with that big interior and so much metal everywhere. fun car for 32k or so. But still think I'd opt for a used bimmer before getting a G35. It still doesn't feel like a legit sport sedan. More a fast sporty sedan. And that engine, while powerful just is too rough when pushed. It sounds like it might break above 5k rpm. No redline on the tach but an annoying light starts to blink at 3500-4k telling me to shift.

As for the S2000, intriguing but not really worth it as the performance from that engine is only marginally better than my 330i perf pack. And the car's not really useful/  Boxster - not to my liking in any way, shape or form - basically it's just heinous.  911's sweet but not my bag either.  Too much like a middle aged man's Vette in my eyes.  Pretty impractical too.  If I were to get a modder beater, it'd be a miata and then I'd turbo it.  Hey, see the new IS?  Bland (but styling's pretty unimportant to me) but the possibility of the 3.5 with 300 hp, RWD, lower driving position and lexus reliability, gets my eyebrows up.  I'm hoping I've finally found something that can at least run with my E46 and not make pine for it."
3014,"March  3, 2005 11:25PM",blueguydotcom,"Chris, nice to see you.  And no I don't hate the G35.  Far from it.  Excellent car that isn't quite there.Regarding seating, lowering the seat would only make me like I'm sitting in a hole and it won't change the fact the car is so damn high.As for handling - please tell me you'll drive the sport model next time. No one complains in fact the 03 had .9 skidpad and 67 slalom (or 66.5 maybe can't remember) - not exactly lumbering.Drove a G35 manual 05 which comes with the 18s.  AFAIK, the manuals come with the sport suspension automatically.  If i'm wrong, please correct me.  I believe I'm right though (remember I wanted to buy an 03). For a car the runs with - and not behind the 3 with ZHP pack - sporty sedan is just plain WRONG. You must have been owned by a G some time ago and have a bad thing for them now. You've been trshing them for over a year while the rest of the automotvie community respects that there is a new benchmark until 06 at least.Owned how?  I don't race people.  I was owned by a G35 03 on a test drive - the car lifted up in the rear on a turn.  Unsettling to say the least.  IMHO, and it's just my opinion (thought other seem to agree), the G35 does not feel as centered or planted on the tarmac as the 330i zhp.  Trust me, I wanted to buy an 03 and I desperately wanted to love the 05 G35.  But the car's handling and engine just didn't match my expectations for a car in this class.  I would love to be in a reliable, fast, competent, japanese sports sedan (not to mention cheap!). But I can't find one!"

And that crappy handling will be just enough to match anything the 3 has..with more legroom.Uh, I haven't touched the 06 3 so I won't comment on the performance.  Though I will say I think the body is ugly, interior bland and the size increase totally unwarranted.  The e46 was already too porky (not just in weight but also size), so the e90 will get a coutesy test drive when i replace my car but I have very low expectations for the car. And for BMW in general.  BTW, my 330i with its measely 235 hp, still pulls perfectly and with no fanfare compared to my experience in the 05 G35.  The inline 6 in my ZHP may not be my favorite engine but god, it's so smooth it makes me wonder how Subaru and Infiniti even try to compete with those engines.  The racket in the highend is insane."

My 3 kids are now 8, 6, and 3, so I'm just a few years beyond you.  We own an Odyssey and just bought  an 05 TL 6MT.  One key for us was enough width across the back seat for the 3 kids, 2 of them in booster seats.  Narrowed to Nissan Maxima (slightly more room) and TL because we felt most of the other contenders in this category would be too small.  So far we're very pleased with our choice.  Getting the kids in and out of the back is not as easy as in the van, but still not a problem.  BTW they love the DVD  surround sound in the Acura and fight over who gets next.

The Maxima is bigger than the TL, but you lose some handling.More importantly, though, I'm concerned about your comment as follows:""The TL has a latch position in the center, so you can place a rear-facing car seat in the middle and still have room for 2 adults on the outside positions.""I have an '04 TL and use a car seat, as I did with my prior 2001.5 Passat, and I don't think there is a center latch set in the Acura.  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE count the number of latches.  I believe you'll find 4, and even though it is possible to attach the seat in the middle, you'll be doing so using the inside passenger-side latch and the inside driver-side latch.  Latches are not tested this way.  They are intended to have pressure applied to the same set of latches.

I was looking at the 05 TL and I am pretty sure there are 3 pairs of latches in the back.  But I will reach in the back seat and count again.  I should find a total of 6 latch connections.

3020,"March  4, 2005 10:23PM",djocks,"I was fortunate enough to drive a 2005 g35 6mt for a few days and it was so interesting to me how I walked away from it.  I was very strongly considering buying the car as a replacement to my 2003 330i as it is bigger and a little more family friendly.  Here is my opinion.1. I know the g35 is faster on paper but it sure does not feel faster.  I guess it has to do with the overall size of the car.  But the BMW simply felt like it had more pop. 2. I do admit the G has the bimmer beat in some areas.  Back seat, stereo, and you can even argue it has a more modern look.  3.  But I am here to tell you that everything people say about BMW's is absolutely correct.  The biggest difference for me was behind the wheel and the connection you have with your surroundings and the road.  It is truly amazing to me.So in conclusion I decided to stay in my 2003 330i and wait to see the 06 3-series. The funniest thing to me was I walked away thinking that it is either a BMW or it is not.  And I will look again in time at the g35 and the new lexus IS but in the end I believe that if I do not get a BMW I am going to load up a Honda Accord and be Mr. family guy.Really whats the difference, because if you want the best, get it.

The 280hp 2005 G35 should be even faster.The G is simply a bigger sedan than the 3.  That alone works against it in terms of handling."

I find the middle position is only nice (1) if there'll be 2 small people sitting in the back, too, or (2) on long trips when the baby can better enjoy looking out the front window with a front-facing seat, or (3) there'll be someone in the front passenger seat and the middle position is easier for them."

A FWD car gets better traction b/c the engine sits over the wheels that drive, and that weight provides increased traction - probably due to increased friction with the road (don't know if there are studies on that).  TCS does not increase traction - it just makes the best use of whatever traction is there by increasing the drive power of whichever wheel has traction.  It can't create traction, which the fwd car does b/c of the engine placement.  I would thing a fwd car would generally be better than rwd w/ TCS."

Those tires (Michelin Arctic-Alpins) have transformed my car from the worst winter driver to the best I have ever had.  Would an AWD equipped car shod with winter tires perform even better?  In acceleration, almost certainly, however, given that my car is still more than capable until the snow rises above the door sills, I don't see any advantage to AWD considering the handling and braking disadvantages that come with the extra weight of the additional drivetrain hardware.Best Regards,Shipo"

I think I'd still pick the 530i.. and eat at a five star restaurant once per month..   ;-)I'm guessing for most people that buy the 545i, that isn't an either/or decision.."
3036,"March  7, 2005  6:40PM",ljwalters1,"I don't know why that would matter.  Traction is traction, whether it's off the line, cruising or in a turn, unless you want to work torque steer into the equation.  I'm not a physicist, so I'm afraid we've reached the limits of my thinking!"
3037,"March  7, 2005  6:57PM",shipo,"""Traction is traction, whether it's off the line, cruising or in a turn...""Well, no, not really.  Static weight distribution (ie. front/rear weight bias) and driving dynamics play a substantial part in winter driving as well.Three examples (assuming two otherwise identical FWD and RWD cars driving in snowy conditions):Acceleration: under light acceleration (ie. very little front to rear weight transfer), the FWD car, with its ~60/40 weight distribution will have more traction than the RWD car with its ~50/50 weight distribution.  However, under stronger acceleration, since weight transfers to the rear in such a situation, the front tires will lose traction whereas the RWD car will gain traction.Around a curve: the lighter back end of the FWD car will come unglued before the heavier front end of the car under some circumstances, while in others (accelerating through a curve for instance), since the front tires are being asked to do double duty (accelerating and turning), they will break loose (and plow) before the back end.  A RWD car with a good traction control system will be less prone to either of those two scenarios.Braking:  The FWD car, which already has a significant front end bias, will load up even more with the weight transfer of braking, allowing the back end to become very light and lose traction, and without the aid of TCS, could very well find said back end leading the front end down the road.  The RWD car, given its better balance will be less susceptible to that situation as well.Best Regards,Shipo"
3038,"March  7, 2005  7:00PM",qbrozen,"No, I haven't tried winter tires.  But, to answer your second question, I have to extrapolate that, since my RWD car has the worst traction while NONE of my cars have winter tires, it would still have the worst traction if ALL of my cars had winter tires.  It may no longer be dangerous, but it would still suffer by comparison.Regardless, I just don't want to spend the money and time, at this point, to buy special tires and change them depending on the weather.  I kept my FWD car so that I can leave the RWD car at home when necessary.Now, let's keep in mind that not all Traction/Stability systems are created equal.  I found the system in the Benz to be FAR more capable (and far more transparent) than the system in my 350Z.  I'm confident that good tires on the Benz, with that system, would be much more suited to adverse weather than my Z with even some of the best tires."
3039,"March  7, 2005  7:13PM",shipo,"Fair enough.  I must say that the TCS system on my 530i is quite impressive, and coupled with the additional winter tires (I ordered the Sport Package which includes summer tires), my car has gone from completely un-drivable in anything more than a dusting of snow to being able to easily plow through six inches as quickly as (if not quicker than) the ubiquitous SUVs that many here in southern New Hamster drive.  Given that we are in the midst of our second one hundred inch or more winter in the last three seasons, I've had ample opportunity to drive with four to six inches on the roads.Best Regards,Shipo"

It's a LOT cheaper than buying/maintaining/insuring two cars.  I don't understand this incredible aversion so many people have to winter tires.  If you live in a snowy area it's a better safety investment than FWD, AWD, airbags, stability control, and all the other things car companies have convinced us to spend money on.dave"

Besides, not only am I saving the miles on my summer tires on the Z, but I'm saving miles off the entire car by driving a different one altogether.Maintenance costs nothing extra because the miles are split between the cars, so I'm still doing maintenance at the same pace if you count performing it half as much on twice the cars.Insurance?  Eh, not enough to worry about.  $40 a month is worth it for me, especially when you figure in the added bonus of being able to keep a 2-seat sportscar on hand while still having the 4-seat sedan for familial duties (whereas many many people sacrifice the sportscar because they had a baby or whatever).  EDIT ... OH, and a whole other set of tires and wheels would cost me probably nearly the same as 2 years of insurance on that 2nd car.Notice I mentioned TIME and money.  Obviously, money isn't the big issue with me.  Time (and something else I forgot - garage storage space for those extra wheels/tires) is.Anyway ... we're really WAY off topic.

3087,"March 11, 2005  6:35PM",shipo,"BillHerrMann,If you had actually read my post you would see that I explained why it wasn't a fair comparison.  Your former 330xi is a car that is running around with AWD hardware, and said hardware is both heavy and has a certain amount of mechanical drag associated with it.  That makes the 330xi significantly slower and less responsive than a like equipped 330i. The CTS 3.6 has a RWD drive train which (like the 330i) is much more efficient, so no, it wasn't a fair comparison.  To make it fair, you would need to compare it to a RWD 330i.  As if the AWD components weren't enough of a handicap, the 330xi only comes equipped with (relatively) skinny All-Season tires, which are not at all conducive to good handling.  IMHO it isn&#146;t even fair to compare a 330i SP to a 330xi, they just ain't the same.Since the lease is up on my 530i SP in a couple of weeks, and since I am going to hold off from getting a new car for a year or so, I've been taking the time to test drive virtually every thing out there, including a CTS 3.6 (automatic, no dealership around here stocks cars with manual transmissions, assuming of course that you can even order one these days).  It was quick, however, not as quick as my 530i 5-Speed, which by the way is no match for a 330i 6-Speed.  As for handling, sorry, the CTS felt like a land barge compared to my 530i, which once again, isn't in the same league as a 330i SP.Regarding trunk space; who cares?  We are talking Performance Sedans here, and like it or not, trunk space is not something high on the priority list of most folks shopping for this type if car.  Will the 330i hold three bags of golf clubs?  Yes.  Good enough!Regarding the pricing numbers you've been throwing around, me thinks you're playing it a little loose.  I configured both cars as follows (which is how I would order them were I going to do so today):Cadillac CTS Luxury Sport: $41,385BMW 330i, PP, SP, Xenon, Heated Front Seats: $40,995The only option that the CTS has that the 330i doesn't have is the UGO, which is an after market accessory costing $145.  In the end, those two cars are as Apples to Apples as it gets, and the BMW costs a whopping $245 less.  Sorry, I cannot get too excited about the price difference.  What I can get excited about is the difference in how they DRIVE (note, not just how they accelerate), and in that comparison, the Cadillac finished a very distant second.Enjoy your CTS.Best Regards,Shipo"

3104,"March 12, 2005 10:57PM",blueguydotcom,"Johnny,I love the TSX.  I can't quite explain its appeal.  I love the clean style, the nice, simple, legant cockpit but more importantly, I go ga-ga for the silky smoth 6 speed in those things.  Like buddah.  I've driven them a few times and I always dug the eager pull of the engine, the delight of keeping the car over 4k rpm with plenty of room to play.  The 330i is a pretty different beast.  The driving dynamics matched with the power won me over.  If you feel like your TSX just isn't there for power,  and if you'd like that special punch in corners of RWD then you'll enjoy the 330i.  Really, the only way you'll know, go drive one.  And let the salesguy know it's all about the handling.  In other words don't let him take you on some anemic on  surface street, then the freeway and back test drive.  You want twists, turns, hills, switchbacks and plenty of opp to flog the car as god intended.Yes, BMWs on the west coast are everywhere!  you can't swing a dead cat in any west coast major city without hitting a bimmer.  Unfortunate but true - one my reason the TSX attracts me.  If I hadn't run across a 330i with manual to drive in 03, I'm sure I woulda ended up in a TSX.  I woulda been fairly happy too.  Just yearned for more power and AWD/RWD.Knowing what I know now about my 330i would I lease again...hmmm.  Most likely yes but I gotta say I'd dwell on it way more. I would probably still lease.  I really wish I could own a BMW, but I simply don't think they're good cars.  All this talk about the 08 M3 4 door has me excited and conflicted.  You just can't lease an M3, it's a car you buy and keep.  And the idea of buying a BMW troubles me.  The idea of owning a lexus, infiniti, mazda, acura doesn't raise my eyebrow in the least."

They also estimated a 0-60 time beating the 330i by a full second since the IS350 will have 300hp under the hood.In summary, they really liked this car, and it will be interesting when they get around to actually testing and comparing both in U.S. spec form."

I saw an E23 7-series (first generation) this morning near a current 530. The 7 actually looked smaller and was certainly lower. Maybe the Porsche Panamera will bring everyone back to their senses. You can bet it will be low slung the way a sport sedan should be. However, if the engine goes up front it may run into a problem I think one of the problems is the new pedestrian safety regs which, among other things, require a certain amount of clearance between the hood and the engine. When the hood height gets raised, so does the rest of the car which may account for the slab-sidedness we&#146;ve been seeing. It certainly appears as if the E90 and new IS conform to these regs, in addition to the other new generations."

The manual shift option was incredibly slow.  I will try to test drive again at another dealer (for the manual).  P.S.

3137,"April 15, 2005 12:42PM",kdshapiro,"Well I couldn't disagree more. After making the rounds to many, many dealers including Subaru I understand why Subaru owners are passionate about their cars. Their interiors may not be up to BMW quality. But their drivetrain is every bit as good. The Forester XT Premium for example, can't hold a candle amenity wise to any car in this thread, but it will go to 60 in 5.25 seconds and it costs $15K less than the 330. The $15K one could save could be invested in another car, the market, your house...etc. So yes, the compromise is in the interior, but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter, engine or drivetrain.While you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30. Show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 5.25 seconds, like the Forester XT(see review in caranddriver.com ) and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway."
3138,"April 15, 2005  3:33PM",blueguydotcom,"So yes, the compromise is in the interior, but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter, engine or drivetrain.Absolutely, 100% disagree.  The engine, shifter and tranny are rough, unrefined, loud and fill me with anything but confidence in the car's abilities.  While you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30. Show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 5.25 seconds, like the Forester XT(see review in caranddriver.com ) and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway.The Scooby XT won't get 30 mpg running 80 mph.  According to Edmunds the 2005 xt manual is rated at 23-24 mpg for the freeway.  The engine runs to high in the rpm to approach that feat.  And at 90 mph, I know it won't come even close to 24.  Turbo 4s are fun but not economical when matched to lousy gearing.Scoobies are fun but they're not on the level of entry lux cars by any stretch."
3139,"April 15, 2005  3:50PM",designman,"that the Legacy GT and Forester XT have sloppy suspensions especially the latter which also has incredibly slow and numb steering. Even the Outback configuration trumps them handily IMO, ironic since they raised the ride height. The driver&#146;s Subies are the WRXs. Outback XT is the best compromise if you need utility."
3140,"April 15, 2005  4:04PM",kdshapiro,"Actually I couldn't disagree more. The shifter is snappy and crisp, the suspension is taut, and the car takes off like greased lightning. Faster than any other car in this thread. It holds the road on par with the FX35/X3. I agree it does not have the amenities and the vehicle does have a numb spot in the steering. But it begs for more, and you can give it more and it inspires the same confidence as the 3er. And it cost $10K++ less than the other vehicles in this board.I agree, you give up some. The interior of the Scooby isn't up to the interior quality of these vehicles. But you pay less, get less amenities but more drive.As for the gas mileage, in this part of the country you don't fly around at 80, unless you want a big fat ticket so I'm not worried. But people I know who have the car get 27+ doing around 65 and that's just fine with me. And did I mention it cost less than the other vehicles in this segment.I'm not promoting the vehicle nor do I really believe it belongs in this thread, IMHO, it has the guts to compete with these other fine cars at a different level. Maybe less luxury and amenities, but it will blow the doors off of them. To some people that's important, to others it's not. There is no right or wrong. YMMV."

Let's face it, most of us do most of our driving in rather routine commuting.  Those of us in the midwest don't have many exciting roads to drive, unlike much of the west and east coast.  I started my search looking at TLs, TSXes, and G35s.  Then the Scottish hertitage kicked in and I asked myself why should I pay $30K+ for my 8 mile city commute.  I just couldn't rationalize it.  I ended up with a Camry SE-V6.  Not as luxurious as the the TL or ES330 (although same powertrain as the latter), not as fast as the G35, not sporty as the BMW but for me, the marginal utility of that extra $7-10,000 just wasn't there.  It's luxurious and fast enough for me though obviously for many of you, it isn't."

3144,"April 16, 2005  7:01PM",buddhabman,designman -  In terms of handling the only car that can be considered to be more poised is the BMW 330i.

3151,"April 18, 2005  8:28PM",kdshapiro,"Hmm. You may be right about the Legacy, I don't think I drove it, I drove the Outback, my impression was it was more trucky like. (I've driven so many they all blend in). But, surely the Forester XT will not outhandle a sedan. But for what it is, silky smooth shifter, power galore with the turbo, taut suspension, spacious cross-over, 5.3 to 60, LSD and $$$ less than an X3, it's a perfect vehicle for some. Heck, it'll blow past an FX45. Can you tell I had a blast driving it? The cabin noise from the windup of the turbo is right on the money. Although it clearly does not belong in the entry level segment, as the amenities are not up to others in the segment, it's a lot of bang for the buck.And finally for those who dwell on such things, it's reliable and it got the IIHS best pick. Comparing it against a 330, no it's not all that, but you know what it's $15K less. And Subaru scrimped in the amenities, not the engine, handling or drivetrain."
3152,"April 20, 2005  5:37AM",jcj1,"I need to make a purchasing decision in the next few days. I have narrowed the field down to two: an Infiniti G35 RWD Sedan or a Subaru Legacy GT LTD Wagon. I can get either car for $500 over invoice via the Costco program, and the two cars are within a couple of hundred dollars of each other with the options I want. For the G35, I opt for RWD because I live in the California where there is no real need for AWD. I'd go with the AT because I feel the G35 accelarate more smoothly with the AT, while the 6MT is a bit notchy and also less practical for my daily commute. For the Subaru, I opt for the Wagon because I love the oversize sunroof and the wagon is a bit roomier and also looks a bit nice (my personal opinion). Unfortunately the AT does not work well with the 2.5 Turbo in the Subaru, and the 5MT with STi short throw shifter and Momo shift knob is so much fun to drive that it reminds me of a Mazda Miata. So I think I'd go with the MT for the Subaru.Now the questions:1) My wife is a bit concerned about the durability of turbo engine as we plan to keep our car for a long time (We kept our last two cars for 10-15 years). Is this a good enough reason to stay away from the Subaru?2) How is the predicted reliability of Subaru compared to Infiniti? This is our No. 1 priority. So far we only have experience with Honda and Toyota which have been pretty much trouble free. Can I expect the same level of quality and reliability from Subaru or Infiniti/Nissan?3) Is $500 over invoice a good price for these cars? Is it worth bargaining for a price that is significantly better than Costco's?Your help is most appreciated. Thanks!"
3153,"April 20, 2005 12:52PM",kdshapiro,"Some thoughts:1. cars with turbos in the long run are probably less problem free than cars without. In 15 years, who can tell what the reliability of a turbo car is? But in 15 years, what will be the reliability of the G35?2. You can get a lot of reliability information from the annual car buyers issue of consumer reports. You can read the Subaru and Infiniti forums for some insight as to the types of issues people are experiencing.3.

So take that for what it's worth. But it is one reason why I downgraded the Saab 9-3 as a replacement for the A4: I just didn't want another turbo for long-term ownership (ended up with a 325i). Look under the hood and you'll see a lot of extra plumbing, sensors, controls, etc. that are related to the turbo. And the thought of something in there spinning at 20K RPM for years and years makes me cringe   ."
3155,"April 20, 2005  2:30PM",shipo,"Back in the 1980s when Chrysler was the largest producer of turbocharged engines in the world, I had not one but two of their cars.  Both were running strong at 100,000 miles when I traded them in, and I had no doubt that they would have continued to provide me with excellent service had I decided to keep them.  Having said that, within my immediate sphere of family and friends, there were five other Mopar turbos that I was aware of, and each one of them required a turbo replacement within the first 75,000 miles (one needed two turbo replacements).  The only difference that I could figure was that while we all followed the standard maintenance plan, I used Mobil-1 while the rest of them used whatever oil their dealership happened to use.I switched to Mobil-1 from Castrol-GTX when I got my first turbo simply because I'd heard of bearing issues due to the oil being coked when the oil supply was abruptly cut off from the hot/high speed turbine bearings at engine shutdown.  I reasoned that the Synthetic oil would be much more capable of resisting coking, and while my sampling of two isn't definitive, it was enough to cause me to use nothing but Mobil-1 in every car I've had since then.Best Regards,Shipo"
3156,"April 21, 2005  2:22PM",gordonwd,"And on my A4 turbo they had a recommended oil-change interval of 5000 miles vs. 7500 miles for the 3.0 V6 model of the same car. Even with that, I heard that there were some issues with engine problems caused by the coking up of the oil if it was not changed on time or a substandard grade was used. I got a letter from Audi regarding this a few months after I had sold the car. Fortunately, I sold it to a friend of mine down the street, so was able to pass on the warning to him."

I drove the auto first* and was dismayed by the noticeable lag on take off.  The 6 speed, on the other hand, had no noticeable lag and I couldn't tell the difference between it and a normally aspirated six.  As far as the shifter goes, it was silky smooth, quick and short.  The road holding was good, but a little softer than I'm used to (though not as soft as MB's reputation for a soft ride).* I had no intention of buy an automatic, it's just that they didn't have any sticks on the lot when I went looking.You're welcome.P.S.: For what it's worth, I wound up buying a '05 325i ZSP in January.

3160,"April 25, 2005  2:09AM",kdshapiro,I understand and am not debating that point. I was only pointing out that after a test drive or two I understand why there is almost a cult like following for the cars. They are not entry level luxos. But the drivetrain is beyond reproach and the shifter is silky smooth.The Forester for example was clocked at 5.3 to 60 by C&D with only 210 hp. Like the Bimmers these cars are sleepers. But again I realize the luxury factor is not up to their bigger cousins.
3161,"April 25, 2005  1:28PM",gordonwd,"That's the ""problem"" with getting into the luxury segment: you get spoiled by all the features that you did quite well without when you didn't know about them   . Two cars ago I owned a Sentra SE-R that I thought was a really great car -- sort of the early 90's equivalent to the WRX in being a pocket-rocket, sleeper type of compact car. When I got my A4, I suddenly woke up to all the features that I didn't have in the Sentra: power windows, climate control, great stereo, and on and on. Now I don't think I can go back to what now seems like a stripped-down car like the Sentra, and in retrospect even my A4 seems like it was lacking compared to my 325i (how did I ever get along without memory power seats??   ). And I just read a road test the other day of a car in this segment, and the reviewer knocked it down because it had heated seats but no heated steering wheel, if you can believe that!"
3162,"April 25, 2005  3:25PM",ljwalters1,"I, too, love the luxury features :shades: , and determine which car I get more by those features than the brand.  With my VW, the ""coolest"" lux feature (that I miss very much   ) is rain-sensing windshield wipers.  Certainly I'm fine with the regular, Hi, Low, Intermittent, but it's great having wipers that change automatically w/o my having to adjust them.  Speed sensing comes close, but no cigar!  The most annoying lux feature on my VW was the redundant radio controls.  1- they operated as a ""seek"" button, as opposed to scrolling through the presents, which was quite annoying.  2- they were on the right-hand side of the steering wheel.  For some reason, I really like those controls on the left.  If I want to use my right-hand, the dash isn't much farther away!  With my current car ('04 TL), the top luxury feature is the voice-recognition nav system, that's integrated to receive voice commands for the radio and the climate control system.  Totally unnecessary, as I can now change the radio stations by using the standard controls, the controls on the steering wheel or my voice), but totally fun!For all you feature buffs out there with heated seats - they're pretty good for keeping your take-out food warm on the drive home.

3179,"April 26, 2005  1:59AM",esf,"About your new car considerations- If you want an A3, you may have to wait like half a year for the 3.2 version, which is the one that would really have you pick it over the Mazda in performance. The 2.0T just isn't powerful enough to compete with that. Also, the 3.2 is supposed to have the DSG transmission from the TT 3.2, but neither A3s are supposed to have quattro until next year. And, BMW isn't giving us the 1 Series. The 1 Series is the Europe and Asia-only hatch. America is getting the 2 Series, a tiny coupe and convertible model. But, you're not going to be able to get it until like 2008. It's still developing. About the A3 again, if you want your car soon, and have the $, maybe you could spring for the S4 Avant instead, and have more performance, luxury and equal style for a bigger price tag. This is because that the 3.2 isn't coming soon. Or, if you can't afford that, look at the A4 Avant or Sedan 3.2. It's supposed to really fly! Anyway, BMW already did confirm a 130i, and it's already on sale in other parts of the world. It's the 230i you want. Also, I don't know how long you can wait, but the next TT is supposed to be a major rocket. It's going to have an Audi Alluminum Space Frame, and it's going to also have the next generation Audi/Volkswagen V6: A 3.6 V6, first being used in the upcoming Passat, is going to generate some 280 horses, and that's not all. Audi is going to make a TTS, supposedly with the 340 horsepower V8 from the S4 (If it can fit), and a TT RS, but I don't know what that monster is gonna have. It should give the Porsche Boxster S and the Mercedes SLK 55 AMG a major heads-up. Or, they'll eat its dust if they don't put the 911 engine in the Boxster and make an SLK 63 AMG!"

That thing weighs nearly 2 tons (3957 to be exact)!  If i wanted something fast I'd just keep my 330i ZHP.  The 2.0 is under 30k nicely optioned and it gets 31 mpg v. 21 mpg.  Take the extra 20k and go buy a used Miata and mod it to the high heavens. .  . This is because that the 3.2 isn't coming soon. Or, if you can't afford that, look at the A4 Avant or Sedan 3.2.

Audi is wedded to a true V6 as it is shorter and is able to be mounted longitudinally and still allow for a nice installation for AWD.

Yes, the interior is not as cockpit like and yes they moved the window controls to the wrong place (left side door) but otherwise the handling is unflappable, the steering more precise, the roadholding amazing, road noise lowered, engine is more responsive and the car is all around far more fun to drive."

3187,"May 26, 2005  5:07PM",djocks,"I am coming off the lease of a 03 330i and I have been shopping a great deal in the recent months.  I like many on this board am in need of a family friendly sedan (4 doors) that will serve primarily as a commuter for me.  I drive about 50 miles a day.I thought for a while that I would like the G35(6MT), but after driving one for almost a day I was not a fan with the way the car set up.  The interior had maxima written all over it (to be honest, it is the interior they should've put in the maxima).  The performance was strong and obviously fast but it did not possess the crisp feeling of my 330i.  So the G35 became an after thought.  (I will speak more on it later)So now it is going to come down to the TL v BMW.  I had the honor of taking out the new 06 325i (6-MT) yesterday and a tip of the hat to everyone waiting for one.  I know what the horsepower says, and I can read the 0-60 times but I say without hesitation that the new 325i absolutely rips the G35 and TL apart.  It feels as fast as my present 330i and the driving experience is actually improved.  It is truly another typical BMW ""how do they do that?"" experiences.  And after driving the 3 cars, anyone who says the G35 or TL is close to the 325i is saying that because that is what they have in their garage.  I am coming at you honestly b/c I am leaning towards the TL, but the fun factor of driving the 325i is not even measurable.  It truly is a 4-door sports car.  The sales person asked if I wanted to take the 330i out and I said no.  Reason being is, if I do, I know I will regret not getting one every day I drive something else.  the other big positive, is the new stereo is ""ABOUT TIME"".  The HK's in BMW's are flat out garbage and have no business being in such a car.  The new logic 7 sounded awesome for the little time I used it.HOWEVER,The feeling from the drivers seat is tight.  Both in a good way, and a bad way.  It is a fully connected driving experience but it still feels small.  A cruising machine this is not.  Now the real bad.  There is no noticeable difference in back seat room.  I am 6' tall and I would want no part of sitting behind me.  Also a very big flaw, it getting in the passenger seat.  I must have looked funny as I got in and out several times, and each time I hit my left knee on the dash which is now bowed out rather than in.  I can hear my wife now saying how much she ""hates getting in and out of that THING!"".  I like the look, but I just feel from the outside the TL looks more aggressive.  Something about the lower rockers that make it look more aggressive.  I like the front and the back does not bother me but I bet that when the M3 hits we all say, wow thats they way they all should look.  Much like the 5 series and M5.  that brings me to the TL and away from the G35.  Since I feel (and you will too if you ever drive the new bimmers) that there is NOTHING like them, it does not make a difference what else you get, it is not the best.  So other factors then come into play.  The total size and interior of the TL I find gorgeous, not to mention they have every toy in the book.  The germans make engines and the Japanese make technology.  The Nav system and stereos on the TL are as you know, simply the best around.  The seats are big and comfortable.  And the back seat is perfect for a father of one who is getting bigger every day.  I live in the northeast and front wheel drive also has advantages.  Simply put the TL is a fast, and very nice touring sedan that is perfect for a commute.  I still need to give things a little thought.  I really would love the BMW but I think the TL is a better fit for my life in 2005.  I am going to be very jealous though every time I see a 330i screeming around some turn and the driver smiling from ear to ear.  I hope you liked my take.....djocks"
3188,"May 26, 2005  5:45PM",laurasdada,"Pick up the TL for your everyday family/commute requirements.  Buy a used 3er for weekend fun.  It sounds like you won't be happy with anything but a 3.  Of course, growing up and having a family often means sacrifice.  Which is why I'm driving an '05 TL instead of an Aston Martin DB9...TL is a great ride, but I've never driven a 3.  As a skiier, grew up with FWD and have always driven FWD.  Of course, with the lousy (in the snow) OEM Bridgestones on my TL, a RWD Bimmer would probably have been better this past winter!"
3189,"May 26, 2005  5:45PM",byronwalter,...you'll probably scamper back the the Bimmer like monkey on fire. I've driven both and thought that the TL was like general anesthesia. Just haul around a low-speed corner quickly in the TL :P
3190,"May 26, 2005  7:27PM",billyperks,I have gone around corners many of times at high speeds in my 03 TLS and it feels pretty darn gone good.
3191,"May 26, 2005 10:12PM",ljwalters1,"I appreciate your assessment.  I have a TL and didn't bother looking at the BMWs b/c I needed a larger car, too.  It would've had to be a 5-series, and there's no way I could afford it.Anyway, I love my '04 6MT TL w/Nav, and don't understand other posters' comments re turns.  The TL handles great - nice and tight, yet very comfortable.  The only negative is torque steer.  In fact, while I'm sure BMW are faster, my TL gives me more power than I can use.  Great acceleration, great handling, great features, etc.  Only problem is the torque steer."
3192,"May 26, 2005 11:04PM",realty_pro,"I test drove the 05TL, 05 G35 and 05 3 series. I totally disagree with the aforementioned assessment, as I opted for the G35 sedan. I added the sport suspension with 18inch rims and the handling is right in the 3 series' league. The RWD drive is the number one attribute to a real performance car and that eliminated the TL. In addition, the TL & 3 series doesn't have the ""umfff"" factor that the G has. The power and acceleration is head snapping. Infiniti put there dollars into the performance..."
3193,"May 27, 2005 12:13AM",byronwalter,"...it is a very good value and I felt that it would make an excellent high-speed cruiser. But the car just didn't feel good or dialed in when going through curves... at least as compared to the 330i I drove or even my under-powered Audi A4 with the itty-bitty 1.8 turbo (Quattro). I admit that this is solely my subjective impression as the test data that I have read in car mags indicate that the TL does generate good handling numbers. But the communication just doesn't seem to be there. The TL I drove really didn't like fast, tight turns. Might just have been that the tires weren't at a proper pressure. But can't argue with the TL pricing... the car is a nice deal, especially compared to the 330i. But between the two I'd shell out the extra $$$ for the bimmer (but I guess I better give the G35 a look).Byron"
3194,"May 27, 2005  4:34PM",djocks,"I would look at the 5 series more also if it were not out of my budget.  I am going to drive the TL again on Tuesday but the first time I thought it drove very nice.  The acceleration was, as you said, all I would ever need and the creature comforts and toys on the inside are absolutely second to none.  Torque steer aint gonna bother my none on the merrit pkwy in CT and it just those times when you really feel like having fun that you will see the difference.  I can not get over how BMW improved so much on what was already the best driving experience in the class.  I am also looking hard into an x3.  I just wish I liked the look more.djocksAnyway, I will keep you posted"
3195,"May 27, 2005  6:13PM",ljwalters1,"""it just those times when you really feel like having fun that you will see the difference""That's been my experience.Regarding the looks of the BMW, I decided awhile ago the exterior looks of a vehicle is tertiary (even less important than secondary!!!!).  Yes, it can provide an ""Ooohh"" factor with the valet, but if the interior is nice and the drive is good, that's all I care about."
3196,"May 27, 2005  7:10PM",aaargh,"When it comes right down to it, the choice between the TL, BMW, and G35 is about what is important to you.  If performance is what is most important to you, the BMW or G35 is the way to go.  They both excel (excuse the pun) in the performance department. But, IMHO, they are a little shy in the size, comfort, and luxury area.If you are looking for a mix of good (albeit not top notch) performance with luxury, the TL is hard to beat, especially at several thousand less than the comparably equipped BMW and G35.I test-drove all 3 (&#145;05 BMW, not &#146;06).  I bought and am very happy with my TL."
3197,"May 27, 2005  7:34PM",ljwalters1,Good assessment.  Reminds me of a post I read where someone called the TL a sporty luxury car and the G35 a sports car with some luxury features.
3198,"May 27, 2005  8:00PM",esfoad,"Hi guys, jumping in a little late here in this discussion, but I also test drove all the above in addition to the Avalon and the Maxima.  I eneded up with the G35X for a couple of reasons.  IMHO it handles as well as the BMW, the brakes were a little better than the BMW.  The Acura is a really nice piece but I felt cramped in it.  I'm 6'-1"" and around 265lbs.  Also the back seat of the TL seamed smaller than the G35X's.  I believe that any of the cars you are looking at will make you smile.  It's a tribute to the manufacturers that we are having this discussion.  Enjoy whichever one you choose and good luck with her."

3200,"May 28, 2005  2:09PM",frisconick,"Consumer Reports and Car and Driver, both tested these cars and the TL was the fastest, even faster than the G35 coupe. Only the BMW M3 was faster than the TL for about 10,000 more. The BMW has slightly better road feel, but the TL handles great around tight turns.

If you want a drivers car get the 3 or G35."
3202,"May 28, 2005  2:57PM",frisconick,"Yes the BMW does handle better but CR rated the TL handling as excellent, but I disagre, the TL is a drivers car.

3204,"May 28, 2005  3:52PM",lmacmil,""" The one you buy, is of course, the best.""  And I will add ""for your particular needs.""  It's silly to argue one choice over another based on a magazine review.  The magazine reviewers have different sets of criteria.  CR is biased towards overall functionality.  They view the car as a transportation appliance.  The enthusiast magazines are looking  primarily at overall performance.  Since most of us don't have California's exciting canyon roads to traverse, that last little bit of handling prowess that the BMW may provide over the FWD TL isn't a meaningful differentiator.  I find the R&T and C&D reviews a little more helpful since they come up with a numeric score.  That allows the reader to weigh his/her criteria differently and possibly arrive at a different conclusion.As has been pointed out many times, these (G, TL, 3) are all very good cars and most of us would be happy with any one of them.  Ultimately, it's probably going to be something subjective (e.g., interior quality, exterior appearance) that sways us to one over another."
3205,"May 28, 2005  4:04PM",frisconick,"Excellent post!  CR does push the cars for performance and CR does not accept advertising so I believe they are more objective.

The steering and power were great, but I found the G35 skittish on high speed corners where bumps existed.The TL is second to none in features and has a very nice interior. It's power is great. I must say now that after 8000 miles on it, I still don't think its handling compares to my A4. It is pretty good compared to most cars, but I was spoiled by the A4. The TL is a little 'floaty' going around curves when bumps are present. I drive to work up a canyon road for a 2 mile stretch and it is a great spot where the handling differences come out.I still really enjoy the TL and will keep it for many years, but when the kids are gone to college I'm going to get a bit better handling car.Needless to say, cars like ES300 or SUVs, minivans are OUT for me from a handling perspective.

Since I'm not having much luck finding a left over '05 330i with the performance pack, I will probably end up in another A4.But why, why, why can't Audi put a decent sport seat in the Audi?

When the car mags do a comparison test, something has to finish last, regardless of advertising dollars spent.  I think if you looked back over the years, you'd find that the finish order changes and usually it's the newest model that finishes first, e.g., the new Infiniti M series is winning most of the comparisons lately.  Now if one manufacturer consistently won every comparison across all model lines, then I might believe the editorial opinions were influenced by advertising dollars.Another thing that favors CR objectivity is that they buy the cars they test.  I'm sure the manufacturer supplied cars that the car mags test are gone over with a fine tooth comb before being given to the magazines to evaluate.  As long as they all do it, I guess the playing field is level."

I have never had a problem of any type with any part of the car (although Acura checked out my tranny at my last oil change per a TSB).  The last time I checked, approx. 1.6 % of the TL population had transmission problems - and Acura did not shy away from their responsibility to repair/replace.   The TL is a great car (still amazed at the thoughfulness that Acura put into the little design details/ergonomics*, engine is flawless, etc.). All car manufacturers will occasionally have technical glitches (I believe the tranny thing was due to a supplier issue) but as long as they step up to the plate and meet their responsibilities - they will have my support and future loyality (i.e. cash).P.S. *a small compliant I can muster is that the sunglass holder (between the visors) seems to be missing in the 04/05 models - if I am remembering correctly from test drive about a year ago.

Nothing handles like a BMW and it is a comfortable reasonably well equipped (after paying for some options). The TL does everything  well and is extremely well equipped for no extra $'s - and is thousands less than the 325. The audio system is extra special. It does have a little torque steer but only when pushed very hard - not in ordinary driving. I have had no problems of any kind with the TL but had several with the BMW with under 1000 miles. I had the air mass monitor fail, the radio has a lot of static and just yesterday the blue tooth telephone connection stopped working. I know I will like the all wheel drive on my BMW in the winter. If I had to pick one I would have a problem. If the TL had all wheel dive it would be a easy pick."

Trans notchy, engine rough- not horrible mind you, but for an every day driver that I have to crank out a nice size check every month..., I like my engine noise, but not this much, gearing seemed short w/ a 6 speed and a 300 hp engine, Seemed to track very nice- had a point and shoot feel to it.  Ride rougher than the 330 w/ sport pkg.Interior: Much improved over last year- actually put real aluminum in there- what a concept.  Seat controls- different...- wife loved them, nice shifter, open, good visibility, Instruments- blah- ugliest of the bunch, lots of options reasonably priced, cool back seat that reclines, no 40/60 fold down, Limited interior/exterior color choices.  Can't put my finger on it, but interior seems 'off.'  Wood package lame.Exterior: Sexy beast, Cool 18 inch rims standard, back end good, but not great.330:Drive: Get out a fork and eat off of the flat torque curve- makes the engine have a more predictable feel, nice tranny- liked the stick shift- reminds me of the sticks they used to put in the Mustangs (1989), engine noise noticeable upon accel, but not at steady speed, new brake hold feature pretty slick (car holds brake on a hill until gas applied).  Handling, well... it is a BMW.  Steering wheel fatter, liked it when gripping in turns.  Don't really know about rear wheel drive- I'm sure I'll like it- live in Denver too.Interior: Clean, gauges easy to read, if you move the seat up a little, you can see a bit of the hood- I hate not seeing the hood, I feel like the front end doesn't exist, Sports seats are awesome, maybe I am just a Honda boy- but they need a clock up high for easy peaks, good visibility, vinyl as standard- cheap, start button worthless w/out comfort access.  General comment: xenon lights and brake system outshine the other vehicles.  ipod compatible-nice, line in for audio, a/c in console to keep favorite beverage cool for later, interior felt open but intimate,  fit and finish- a cut above- I am a big fan of wood- warms the interior up, liked beverage holder placement- don't have to do the funky chicken to pull my drink from down low.  Wide interior/exterior color choices.  Why won't Acura do a blue/tan combo?Exterior- classic, nice flowing lines, back end finally flows, muscular- but not over done, standard 16 inch wheels- lame- their option line up doesn't allow for 17's though.

Do you really think these magazines would compromise their journalistic integrity by letting the road test editors get free cars?  I think these stories get started when someone doesn't agree with their reviews and/or comparison test choices.Let's face it, aside from the objective measurements, every review is an opinion.  These guys have their own set of biases based on their experience just like we all do.  The only difference is that they drive cars for a living so their opinions are formed with more driving experience than most of us have. They have days (or weeks) and many hundreds miles on which to base their opinions rather than the hour or less and probably less than 50 miles for our test drives."

I think that you'd be happier in an A4, if you have one right now, than a new 3. I've seen two in person, driving, and they're not very impressive to look at. The 3 doesn't have as much presence as the old one, while the A4, from the back, looks like a little A8. After my '00 A6 2.7t's lease was up in April, I was taking delivery on a new convertible. I was pretty much completely sure of the S4 Cabriolet [which I have now, and am obsessed with], but I also checked out the M3 Convertible. It wasn't nearly as refined as the S4, and I am completely in love with my Sprint Blue S4 Cabriolet. I get so many admiring looks from people, the neighbors love it, and especially my family. Me, my wife, my son, and my daughter, [and also my son who can't drive yet, he's 12] fight over who gets the car next!"

FYI - don't know which model you drove, but the manual has a tighter suspension than the automatic, unless the automatic is an A-spec version.  A 6MT w/ the sport tires rides even tighter.I don't think the TL is intended to be a true sports sedan, like BMW or Infiniti G35.  I think it intends to be a very sporty car that's 1 notch above entry-level luxury, and I think it does that very well."
3239,"May 30, 2005  6:34PM",frisconick,"Very well put ljwalters1.  However, the TL is a seriously quick car for a non-sports car. I test drove a 330i, 330Ci and the G35 coupe, and I am leaning towards the G35, just because it's not a BMW, tuff choice I admitt.  I really loved the 330Ci I admitt."

The A4 seems like a pretty good deal compared to the 330i (I guess that the two liter really should be compared to the 325). There was about a month between the A4 and Bimmer drive so I can't pretend to give any sort of objective comparison... other than to say that they are both great. Frankly I can live with the exterior of the 330 but it's the interior that seems wanting, especially compared to the Audi and the TL. For 40 big ones I expect not only excellent road manners but an interior commensurate with the price. Later this year I'll go back and give the A4 another spin and mostly likely buy one.But my fav was actually the STi. That little car ducks and weaves like Ali and growls like a Tasmanian Devil in heat. Anyone that considers themselves a car enthusiast should consider taking one for a spin. But the Subie is a bit thirsty and frankly I feel that things are going to get nasty in the energy sector. I currently manage a little better than 26 mpg with my '02 A4 and guess that the new A4 2.0t can even do a little better which is pretty good for AWD.Ah... the hard choices we must make...Byron"

In fact, a website that sells tires (might be Tire Rack - not sure) will only sell snow tires as a set of 4."
3248,"May 31, 2005  3:36PM",tstreet,"Not sure if it was a fair fight, seeing as the M35 is about 8-10k more, but I gave each of these cars an extensive road test.  I have 2 friends with TLs and I have really fallen for them.  However, after I tried Infiniti's M35, I never went back to the TL.  At first glance the M35 is priced near 50k as seen on most dealer lots, but I soon realized that was with their ""sport"" edition.  Turns out their base model rides much smoother, similar to the TL, and is only 40k.  I opted for a couple packages and left the dealer at 44.6k  Ultimately, the performance is pretty similar.  They're both in that 270-280 HP range.  I ended up making my decision on interior features and ""uniqueness"".  One key factor was road noise - this was a hands down winner for the M35.  As a frequent L.A. freeway driver, and as someone that often has passengers, this was important.  Other things I preferred on the M35 - Standard 18"" wheels (19"" on the sport), more back seat leg room, and way more exterior color options.  That said, the TL is probably still the best buy on the market, but I love my M35."
3249,"May 31, 2005  6:29PM",laurasdada,"Hi, Al:I'm in the Boston area with an '05 non-nav TL, Bridgestone Turanza EL42 tires.  They are the worst tires in the snow that I've experienced in almost 30 years of driving (at least that I remember!).  I got through this past snowy winter with the aid of all the traction electronics, common snow-driving sense and luck!  We took the wife's RX300 on our few ski trips, but if I was going to regularly take my TL to ME, NH, VT etc.  I would definately buy four snows or at the very least upgrade to a much better snow performing all-season.  In addition, I believe these tires flat spot (maybe that 's a characteristic of low profile tires?) which is a bit annoying.  Other than that, they seem ok.  If you get a NAV model, or 6MT I think you'll get different tires which others would have to comment on, snow-wise.  Other than the tires, I'm really enjoying the TL.  Applied three coats of Zaino on Sunday, the Abyss Blue looks great!"
3250,"May 31, 2005  6:39PM",laurasdada,"TST, good post.  It's funny, I bought my TL over the G35X because I found the TL to be much smoother, quieter ride and nicer interior style/materials.  Not to mention the superior exterior style of the TL.Probably a more apples to apples comparison would have been the RL to the M35.  But luckily, we both made the right choice in our purchases!

3252,"May 31, 2005  8:15PM",esfoad,"I bought the G35X over the TL for a couple of reasons.  Nav was not important to me since I have an aftermarket Garmin that suits my purposes.  I feel that the G35 has a roomier interior.  I also liked the all wheel drive functionality for the winter but that it is all but off when you don't need it making the car feel like a rear driver.  I grew up driving rear drive vehicles and I just prefer them.  THe wife drives a Saab 9-3 Aero convertible and it's a great machine but the torque steer, while minimized, is still annoying.  It's really splitting hairs here.  These are both fabulous cars.  It amazes me that the manufacturers have improved so much over the years.  What a great time to be buying cars.  I hope everyone enjoys their purchase, whatever it may be."
3253,"May 31, 2005  8:23PM",aaargh,"I feel that the G35 has a roomier interior.That's odd, because I came to the exact opposite conclusion.  I think the G35 is taller and narrower and has a bit more rear-seat leg room than the TL.  But the rear-seat head-room on the TL I found much better.  I know you can recline the G's back seat, but I found it to be uncomfortable when reclined.As far as space is concerned, the TL felt wider (roomier), more like a Grand Prix compared to the G35 which I felt was similar to a Grand Am. (The 2 Pontiacs were my last 2 cars before the TL).I wish the TL had better storage compartments though."
3254,"May 31, 2005  9:45PM",ljwalters1,"I agree with you regarding the TL feeling roomier than the G.  I bet the measurements are similar, but some aspect just makes the G feel more closed-in to me.  Maybe it's as simple as the fact that the G35 I drove had a black interior - that could've made it seem smaller.Regardless I'm happy with the TL, and not sure what other storage space you would want, aaargh.  We've got side door sill pockets that expand; a bi-level center console that's so deep they added a light to it; rear seatbacks; a little flip-out drawer in the back of the center console; closable/concealable cupholders; 2 drawers in the center-stack (maybe more if you don't have nav); and a decent-sized glove box.  Only thing I can figure is you want a sunglass-holder in the roof or a drawer under the dash on the left side.  Overall, I think there's a lot of storage space."
3255,"June  1, 2005  2:07AM",esfoad,"I guess it's each to his/her own regarding space.  They must be very similar.  Once again, they are both great cars.  The TL is on everybody's best buy list and the G35 is constantly compared to the BMW 3 series.  I think either choice is a good one."

3260,"June  3, 2005  2:23PM",jamesspot,"I drove all three (with automatics) on an autocross course last year. Here's my take:G35: The muscle car of the bunch. Powerful, thirsty, noisier engine. The car the folks running the event told me after my lap to ""keep it down."" It will power slide in a heartbeat! Would be the fastest with a good driver who could maximize its engine potential. Enough interior room to scare 4 other people along with the driver.TL: The luxury bargain of this class. Plowed in hard turns, but a comfortable ride and a roomy, luxurious, and quiet interior. The one for a highway road trip with 4 passengers. Fast enough to merge on ANY expressway, but not adept on a tight-turning course.330i: I haven't driven the E90, yet, but the E46 platform was the balanced sport sedan. Faster for me on the track because of the smooth power, even braking, and outstanding handling. Made me look smooth going flat out. Best for a 2 person car with occasional rear seat passengers."

IMO the G35 handles very well, and comparing the price and reliability issues to a 330i, I was seriously considering one.  However, when testing it out, I found the noise level unacceptable (for me) and would never buy it on that issue alone - I'm not a twenty year old.  The TL is just as jamesspot reviewed - he described my brother's driving style perfectly.  My brother is a retired banker and he loves the car.  I recently purchased a CPO 330Cic for my wife - she loves the convertible.  I'm looking forward to testing out the IS250/350.  I liked the IS300 performance/handling a lot but it was a little small and boy racer for me.  If the new one handles close to the BMW and with a competitive price, I'd sell my 540iA for one.Regardless, all these cars are great - we're fortunate to have so much choice."
3275,"June  4, 2005  1:33PM",kdshapiro,"Why has BMW resisted going to a 3.5 liter engine? The numbers from BMWs new engines are impressive, but the competition is moving up to 3.5 liters.Some thoughts:1. They are trying to keep the power in the engines commesurate with the overall line up and the introduction of a 3.5L would throw everything off.2. They want their gas guzzlers to be the big 8 cylinder engines. Comparing the 3.5L in the G35 to the old 3L in the E46, a friend who has a simliar commute as me gets 17 mpg, where I get 24. One can't have it both ways. A bigger engine that is thrifty on gas, but long on performance, unless they play with the gearing. One can probably expect real-world numbers to be in-line with the G35.3. The heavier engine throws off the delicate balance of the car.4. A 3.5 engine would not substantially make the car faster. People who post in the forums constantly say the G35 feels much faster than the 330i, but the stats as quoted in the magazines over the years don't really bear that out."
3276,"June  4, 2005  4:09PM",kasperghost,"Kd- good points, and...I think part of the engine size/power has to do with an auto makers philosophy.  Ford, BMW and Honda all seem to subscribe to ""Selling well, don't change it.""  For years, Ford's top selling Explorer sported a massive 160 hp and a stump pullin' 160(?) lbs. of torque, 4 ltr. engine.  It sold well, why change it?  In general, the big three tend to follow this model with Ford being the most conservative.  Honda is another example.  I think that BMW follows this as well.Also, why do we need more and more?  These automakers have all done well with the ""We don't need more (fill in the blank) to compete"" philosophy.  They take what they have and refine and polish.  When we bought our Pathfinder, we looked at the Explorer and liked a lot of the features; many of them very simple like the ability to fold the rear seats without taking the headrests off.  Our Accord is a much more thought out car than our Pathfinder.  I'll be sad to see it go."

TL is at 3.2, A4 is 1.8 to 3.0, Lexus ES is 3.3, Mercedes C-class is 2.4-3.2.  Now that they've tweaked the 3 liter to 255 hp, why bother with another configuration?I think the G35 is geared lower than most of the competition, which is how it gets its slight acceleration advantage but fuel economy suffers.

I think BMW's have been overhyped, especially by all magazine reviews. Does a BMW really peform/feel better then a more powerful G35? you may not think so, but you've not driven them apparently.  Even people who opt for a G35 will admit the cars have distinctly different personalities.

In 2003 the G35 arrived and finally put some heat on the 3 series.  The TL's sold well and will continue to without hurting BMW as it's not aimed at the same kinda driver.  MB's never been big on power and Audi wasn't all that either.  Only over the last 3 years has HP become a big issue (many would point to the G35 as the impetus for this).  Actually drive the cars, then comment on if it makes a difference that Caddy's CTS makes 255 hp or Infiniti's G pulls 298.  Once ya drive them you'll see it's not all about the engine numbers.  Audi's 3300 lb A3 with automatic (DSG) and a 2 liter 200 hp engine runs 6.2-6.3 0-60 dashes...in 2003 the 260 hp automatic G35 with the 3.5 VQ ran 6.2-6.3 0-60 dashes.

Lexus made a point of mentioning great fuel economy with their new IS250/350.  BMW mentioned the increase in economy on the e90 too.  It does make a difference.  I know I can beat the hell out of my e46 all day and still get 22/23 mpg while shifting at 5500-6k.  I also know from experience with a G35 i'll get in the high teens doing that.  And no matter how I drive a G35 on the open road...it simply will not get 30 mpg. 30 mpg as most have pointed out here is a snap with a 330i on the open road at hyper legal speeds.After ownership, anyone in here think about maintenance cost?BMW vs G35? Yes most of us did and that's why many of us opted for included service cars like Audi and BMW.  I've bought tires over the past 2 years.  Two sets so far...so about 2k on tires.  Doesn't matter if I got a G35 or 330i, i'd still be plunking down for new tires every 13-15k miles of driving.  The people I know with G35s have had to pay for oil changes, services (some as little as $100 and others over $500 for 15k mile check and 30k mile check up).  Getting an oil change every 7.5k with synthetic will run you at least $50.  So even going low, a G35 by 30k miles will cost at minimum (not including tires) $400.  My BMW = 0.but what about outside warranty?  Average buyers in this bracket don't own more than 3-4 years.  I leased my 330i expressly so I'd never own it out of warranty.  In other words by 45k miles I will have bought tires for my car.  Has it had problems in the first 30k miles?  Yep.  They haven't cost me one cent.  So I really don't care if the car breaks down.  It goes to the shop and gets fixed.  No big deal.  Five minute drive to the dealer and I can always use my other car or get a loaner.  :P"

Two aspects I am disappointed in are the harsh ride due to the run flats and the lack of initial acceleration.  The acceleration is very slow after a stop.  In fact my 323i has a smoother and quicker acceleration than the new 330i.  The ride is much harsher and I don't get the same ""hug the road"" feel as I do with my 323i.  I will seriously look at the redesigned MB C class when it comes out in 2007-2008 and possibly the next E Class or 5 Series.

If all you value is HP, maybe Chrysler will sell you a Viper V10 engine for your living room...What makes our economy the well oiled machine that it is is the lovely law of supply and demand (and, of course, competition.  Laisse faire, Adam Smith and all that economic stuff...Simplifed explanation from a simple mind).  Anybody can charge any price for anything they want.  But, if there is no demand, guess what?  That item is repriced (e.g. GM cars, ""Employee pricing for everyone!"") or withdrawn from the market (Are they still making the Aztek?).  For a myriad of reasons, European cars have always been more exepensive than their domestic & Japaneese counterparts.  (Although, with the advent of Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, European prices have come down.  More supply/competition in the near/luxury market).  However, as there is enough demand for BMW products, well, that's the price you pay, Doc.  You want BMW prices to come down to G35 levels?  You'd better start convincing the KDs and BlueGuys of the world not to keep buying Bimmers.Obviously, a BMW is overpriced to you.  You are correct.  To KD & BlueGuy, a BMW is a good value.  They are correct.  I believe my TL to be a great car and value, I'm correct.    I'm sure CTS owners feel their car is fabulous.  They are incorrect...  Drive 'em all, buy one and enjoy!"

If we are talking about the Infinit G35 versus the Acura TL versus the BMW 3 series, I have these comments.Acura has the largest interior (think Honda Accord sized interior) then the Infiniti (think Civic sized interior) then the BMW (which feels cramped, think excel sizedinterior). The BMW 3 series has the best interior design, then its a toss-up between the infiniti and the acura.The infiniti has the best acceleration, the BMW 3 series comes next with its high low end torque, the acura it right on its heels and the BMW 325 series really isn't in this category when it comes to performance.The BMW feels like a higher HP/torque car than the numbers would indicate but it is still not as powerful as the infiniti and loses out to the acura at higher speeds.  However, the low end torque really does make a big difference in how the car feels.The BMW has the most responsive handling, followed closely by the infiniti and the acura trails having the most ""luxury feel"" of the three.The Acura has the best NAV system, the other two suck.The G-35s have intellikey technology which means that you never have to take the key out of your pocket, as long as the key is your pocket, you can open the doors and start the engine (makes it pretty tough to get carjacked).All three of them sell for about invoice in the Washington DC area (the infinitis sell for slightly below invoice, the acuras for slightly above invoice and the BMWs are currently selling for around invoice (mainly because BMW has announced a minor midyear redesign, they are adding the intellikey technology of the G35 and improving their ""worst of class"" NAV system).If the NAV system and the keyless technology isn't important to you, then you may be able to get a good deal on a BMW after they start shipping the new BMWs with intellikey technology and upgraded NAV system.BTW get internet quotes BEFORE you ever step on a lot and see if anyone will beat them (I have had trouble getting anyone to beat the lowest internet quotes, actually I haven't been able to do it yet)."

I would probably have purchased the Accura TL if it had rear wheel drive. I think it's the best looking of the three cars. Unfortunately, although I've owned some front wheel drive cars, I find them very unsatisfyining to drive near the limit. Too much understeer in the corners and torque steer during acceleration.     The Infiniti, blessed with rear wheel drive, is only a little behind the Accura TL in appearance and well ahead of the BMW 3 series. When the last BMW generation came out I couldn't order one fast enough. The new style leaves me cold. Additionally, to get comparable performance from a BMW, I'd need to get the 3.0 engine and spend a whole lot more than for the Infiniti.       When I test drive a car I usually scare the salesperson and I've tried all three cars. I like them all in different ways, but when it came down to my personal tastes the Infiniti was the best all around package for me. Unfortunately Infiniti makes very few (1%-2%) 6 speeds, so I've had to wait almost two months for my special order.       All three of these cars are excellent vehicles. You will enjoy whatever you select."

3375,"June 14, 2005  4:47PM",gordonwd,"I think that the main reason for U.S. (and elsewhere?) BMW sales being down in the early months of this year has a simple explanation. The 3 series is far and away the biggest seller for BMW -- a large percentage of their sales. And since at least the first of the year, if not sooner, everyone who knows anything about BMWs has known that the new car would be out in the April/May timeframe. So the sales downturn was probably due in a large part to people waiting for the E90 to come out. The reduced sales might continue for a while yet as others wait for the other versions of the E90 to start arriving here (the 325, ix models, etc.).Once BMW gets the full range of E90s into production and on the lots, I would guess that their sales will be right back on target."

I really don't think I would want to be in any other car when I'm approaching a sharp turn at high speeds. However, I doubt I'll be driving that way most of the time, especially since it's my car!  Also, pricing does mean something to me. I configured the 325 and the G35 on their websites, similarly equipped. The MSRP for the 325 was $40,400 and for the G was $35,800, a price difference of $4,600. The BMW does have bluetooth, which is important to me. However, I don't know I can justify the price difference to myself, especially knowing I can deal significantly on the G35. I expect the ""real world"" price difference between these vehicles would be close to 6-7 K after the deals were done.  Does anyone know if there will be any changes to the 2006 GS?

If anything, the TL is the worst of the three on wet roads.  Why?  Its FWD related torque steer, which is only a problem at the highest of power settings on dry roads, becomes and absolute nightmare when accelerating from a stop and turning at the same time, or when accelerating/climbing a hill on a curve.

3381,"June 15, 2005  4:42PM",potemkin,"I bought my 325i in January because I bought a 318ti back in August of 1995.  Ten years on and that ti still drives like new.  Over those ten years it had one mechanical failure (the ignition switch went bad) apart from the usual wear-and-tear items (batteries, tires, etc.)  I hated the idea of trading it in so much that I put off buying a new car for as long as I could.  Then it hit me: Buy a new car and don't trade in the ti.I came close to buying a MB C230 late last year but the deal fell through.  I looked at the G35, but they told me the manuals wouldn't be out until February.  I considered the IS300, but no dealers in my area had any manuals in stock, and none of them had any on order, nor were they planning on adding any to their inventory, ever.The Acura and Audi are FWD...The BMW was pretty much the only choice.I'd gone seven years without a car payment.  Now I have two BMWs and I still don't have a car payment.Besides, the 3-series isn't a re-badged 350Z, or Accord... and the IS300's tail looks an awful lot like a Corolla to me."
3382,"June 15, 2005 10:21PM",bmw3434,"New to the forum, but here's my opinion...Recently, I had a chance to drive the BMW 330i, Acura TL and G35. It was in a large parking lot with acres of cones set up.We had a chance to drive them as hard as we wanted back-to-back-to-back several times.Now, I'll preface this by saying I know that you are not going to hop off the interstate only to find yourself in a 300 ft. slalom through cones leading into a 180-degree hairpin, but...The TL's front end could not be controlled. I couldn't dive into a corner and accelerate out, otherwise a few cones would find themselves lodged underneath the front end. Sure, the interior was nice, and it was a rather large car.The G35 was powerful, take-off speed was great, but when it came to turning the car back-and-forth, the body roll was horrible. It took a few laps just to be able to predict where the thing was going to straighten up and hopefully hit the right line.That is what I loved about the BMW 330i. It was predictable, precise. I was always in control. The power was there, the handling was there (steering was tighter) ... It was a better all-around car in that situation.Granted, when we took them on the interstate, all felt solid at 80mph+.So, a lot will have to do with looks and price I'm sure, but one thing not being taken into account here is maintenance. Sure, the Japanese cars (which, let's face it are Hondas and Nissans) will not cost as much to maintain, but BMW's is free anyway. I think you have to figure that in when you are doing price comparisons.Any response is appreciated, and I've really enjoyed reading everyone's opinion during the last few days."

They had an autocross of sorts set up, and I was able to aggressively drive the TL, 330i (E46), and G35 back to back.As I recall, my impressions were that the TL was too soft (no surprise). The body roll was pronounced, and the car pushed through corners like the nose heavy, all-season tire wearing car that it was. It does have a fine interior though...Next, the 330i (non-SP). The BMW had the best ride/handling compromise of the three, but it too felt soft when pushed hard through the corners. It didn't understeer as much as the TL, but it still pushed at the limit, and the body roll was significant enough for me to be turned off. With auto transmission, it was also the dog of the group.Finally, I was most impressed with the G35. It was the Sports Car of the bunch. It had the most powerful acceleration and strongest feeling motor, and the suspension was firm (just right for me). It's remarkable that a car this large and heavy can feel so light and tossable. Body motions were well controlled, and the car was easy to steer with throttle. I do know, however, from a not-too-recent test drive that it's freeway ride is the harshest of the bunch. It's interior, though improved last year, still strikes me as cheap and contrived.If I had to choose one as a daily driver, I'd have to take th middle road and say the BMW has the best compromise of the group. Soft enough to be comfortable on trips, but firm enough to have fun with. Certainly closer to ideal with the Sport Package and 3 pedals.

Back then I was a happy 1995 VR6 Passat GLX 5-Speed driver and was looking forward to getting a 1999 Passat with the same basic features as my 1995 plus a couple of extra goodies like power memory seats, climate control and automatic wipers.  As fortune would have it, the 1998 Passat GLX was equipped exactly as I wanted my next car to be equipped, then came the 1999 model year.  Bzzzt!  I'm sorry, that is incorrect!  Why?  VW in their infinite wisdom discontinued the 5-Speed manual for that model year, and that model year only.  Why?  Beats the willies out of me.As I refused to yield on my combination of a manual transmission and at the very least the power seats (I was valet parking two to three times a week at that time and YIKES can a parking valet screw up a perfectly positioned manual seat), and climate control (I hate fiddling with the controls every time the sun goes behind a cloud in the summer time).  So, with the above in mind, that left the following cars:- Infiniti I30/Nissan Maxima twins (ugly and mushy suspensions compared to my Passat)- Audi A4 (too small in the back seat area -- two kids in car seats you know)- Saab 9-3 (local dealer refused to order me one with a 5-Speed)- Volvo S70 (same dealer as the Saab, and the same attitude regarding the 5-Speed)- BMW 528i (too slow, couldn't afford the 540i, and ewwww, that BMW stigma)- BMW 328i (a little smaller inside than the 1999 Passat but otherwise just about perfect excepting of course for that same BMW stigma)With all of that said, once I drove the 328i, I was hooked.

Look, I understand if you drive bmw and do not even know what model is that you are driving, like the girl in blueguydotcom’s example – those people simply do not deserve to drive this great vehicle. On a contrary I know my car in and out, I understand exactly what I am driving. But at the same time, when I decided that I am buying a new car I had no doubt about the make. And the thing “because it is bmw” was my main reason. Simply because I always liked this car. I always wanted this car. I always respected this car and even people who are driving this car simply because for me bmw is a symbol. Symbol of something positive. Symbol of me achieved something for just 13 years living in USA. Something that I would never be able to achieve in my native country doing things legally. I hope you understand what I am trying to say. So, what’s wrong with loving BMW just because it is BMW?mike"

3425,"June 17, 2005  4:28PM",shipo,"The ""Stigma"" that I was referring to, and what I objected to, is sort of two separate parts:1) The poseurs who buy a BMW to make a statement but have no idea/inclination on how to actually drive the damn thing2) The ""Slash & Burn"" drivers, which in days gone by were often exemplified by someone in a BMW slicing his or her way down a crowded roadway, cutting off folks with blatant disregard for anybody but themselves.From my perspective, you cannot do anything about Stigma #1, it is what it is and now with the advent of the Japanese luxury brands, the BMW poseur thing has been reasonably diluted.  As for the Stigma #2 folks, that too seems to have been a bit diluted in recent years with the advent of slammed Hondas, Neons and Gallants that many gear heads seem to be fond of.At this point, now seven years after I initially went through the process of convincing myself to even consider driving a BMW, I don't even give it a second thought.  I have really liked my two BMWs, and it is surely going to take one hell of an amazing car from some other marque for me seriously look elsewhere.Best Regards,Shipo"
3426,"June 17, 2005  4:34PM",kominsky,"I was incredibly nervous about buying mine.  As a matter of fact, I delayed my purchase over a year because I wanted BMW - the car - but didn't want BMW - the name.  I live in a pretty rural, mostly farming area.  There is not much money (at least not on display) in the area and an early 80's F150 is much more common than anything foreign.  Before I got my car, I knew of only one other BMW in our area and it was an old, rusting junk pile sitting next to a barn.  On top of that, in my family - immediate, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc  - I'm the only person with a college degree so again, not too much money floating around.  I was afraid that by buying the BMW, it would be seen as me showing off.  In local terms, ""getting too big for my britches"".  In hindsight, that never materialized."

I don't want to be associated with yuppie achievers and wannabes anymore than the association one gets from owning a secretaries' car like an Eclipse or a the million pejoratives associated with Camaro/Mustang/Vette owners. The list goes on and on.  At least Infiniti and Acura's TSX/TL/RL don't suffer from preconceived notions...they're simply solid, nice cars.In the 80s and 90s Yuppies made BMW a symbol of greed, selfishness, conspicuous consumption (not at hummer levels but close) and new wealth.  The car's abilities have become second to the logo.  Buy one and you're immediately associated with that group of people.  I recall a really close friend, a girl who worked for me and I view like a little sister, responded quite simply when I told her I bought a BMW, ""But you're not one of those people.""  Yes, apparently I am.    She's an attorney now at a huge law firm and she's making megabucks.  When asked what she'll buy for her next car, she responds the same way, ""I'll keep my Hyundai until the wheels fall off."" Ah but you're an individual and you're not part of that culture...right, but the reality is that people treat you differently based on things like the car you're driving (or the clothes you're wearing).  I get 500% more people talking to me when I'm in the BMW.  Especially girls.  I don't like that!  I stop for gas and people talk to me about the car.  I don't like that!  Other people in BMWs think we're in some kind of special fraternity and talk to me as if I know them.  I don't like that.  A few people I know - people I would not call friends - will ask me, ""Which car did you drive tonight?""  What difference does it make; they both seat 5! If the car didn't drive the way it does, I wouldn't have bought one.  Fought it tooth and nail and now I'm stuck in some guilt-ridden, angst-filled world where I despise what my car represents to 99% of the world but love the moment I turn the engine on."

And if people mistakenly associate me with that group that you despise, well, there is nothing I can do, but at least it will never have any influence on my love to this car and on my enjoyment driving and owning it.  And if I get more attention and respect from other just because I drive bmw –let it be so. If I have a chance –I’ll certainly show that I deserve respect for other reasons and not because I drive bmw. If I don’t have that chance, well... I cannot change the world.

Also, as a lifelong skier and denizen of the mountains of Vermont, New Hampster and Maine I prefer front wheel drive.  I'll give up the 9 or 10/10ths handling advantages of RWD for the traction (and packaging) of FWD.  The TL handles very well for my tastes.  Having said that, the tires on the base TL are TERRIBLE in the snow!  That'll teach me.  I considered a 325x/330x but I decided I didn't need the added weight and complexity of AWD.  I've gotten along just fine without AWD lo these many years in the snow/mountains.  Not to mention my New England frugality just wouldn't let me spend so much more for the BMW, especially since I knew the '06 were on the way.  Similarly equipped, the TL is less money.  Had I really wanted the 3, I would have bought it and I'm sure loved it.  But, for me, the TL was a bertter car and value.  I also shopped the G35 and Mercedes E320 ( a different animal, I know, but it is such an appealing car to me.  Again, I just didn't see the value proposition).Of course now with 20/20 hindsight and a N.E. winter behind me, a rwd 3 with decent all-seasons would probably have better traction than my TL with the Bridgestones (they're supposedly all-seasons as long as none of the seasons include snow) in the snow!  The best laid plans...Anyway, had I gone with any of the other ELLPS I'm sure I would have been just as happy as I am with the TL.  A wonderful class of cars, tough decision.

(eg. #3608, why people buy BMW)Finally there's no hesitation to question a BMW's value.  It almost seemed people are afraid to question BMW's, since it's been foolishly jamed into minds...BMW's are ""high performance, high quality..."".  Mostly by magazines(press), friends(who like the label), and the high price to own.But as these posts say, it's mostly opinion, and actually, BMW's probably aren't worth the high price for similar performance.One thing I still don't see many people admitting, is BMW, Benzes, and Audi's low reliability and high cost of maintanance.  I feel this is in the direction of pride.  No one likes to admit cost paid, vs more cost spent to maintain.And it is fact, BMW's do break down more then average, consumeraffairs.com/news03/jdpower.html little old (2003)benz clsdiff class2002and it does cost more once it's in shop (vs Asian, US brands).  Of course it depends who drives, but when the car is in the shop, pull out the wallet."
3471,"June 21, 2005  5:10AM",shipo,"One of the biggest problems that I have with folks who like to take issue with owning a BMW is that they like to dwell on the negative by slamming BMW because they are &#147;unreliable and expensive to maintain&#148;.  That line of bilge has been repeated so often that to some at least, it has become fact.  Sorry, but I have never seen any evidence, scientific, anecdotal or otherwise to support such a claim.  The simple truth is that cars, ALL cars, are far more reliable now then they have been at anytime in history, and BMWs are some of the most reliable.Ahhh, buy the naysayers will say, ""Oh yeah!  Well just look at the statistics referenced in the above post.  You'll see that Toyota has 196/PP100 vs. BMWs 262/PP100 rating.""Uh-huh, well personally both numbers look pretty damn good to me, and furthermore, comparing the full North American BMW line (all fairly complex performance/luxury cars) to the full line of Toyotas (starting with no/low option strppo econo-boxes with far fewer components to fail) seems to be a bit disingenuous if you ask me.  To my way of thinking at least, a much more fair comparison would be Lexus vs. BMW, and while I haven't seen those numbers in a while, if memory serves, the gap was much narrower.  Even still, the report shows that for every four problems reported by a Toyota owner, a BMW owner will report roughly five.  So much for being &#147;unreliable&#148;.  I did find it interesting to note that BMW and a few other European manufacturers were singled out in the following quote: &#147;Porsche, Jaguar, Saab and BMW perform well above the industry average in dependability&#148; as being quite reliable.Another knock that I continually read about BMWs is that they cost a lot of money to maintain.  That too is pure fabrication.  The only out of pocket expense a late model BMW owner should experience for the first 50,000 miles is tires.  Period, full stop, the end.  Everything else is covered under the full maintenance program.  Once a car has enough miles and/or years to no longer be covered under the maintenance program, they seem pretty reasonable to maintain, especially given their very long service intervals called for in the Owner's Manual.  Basically, change the oil every year or 15,000 miles, change the brake fluid every two years and the coolant every three or four years (IIRC).  As for the scheduled ""Services"", those occur every 30,000 miles, and while the cost can range from $600 to over $1,000, when you consider the number of miles that cost gets amortized over, it just ain't that much money.Said another way, my bet is that if you were to do an ""Apples to Apples"" comparison of a new E90 3-Series vs. a new second generation Lexus IS, my bet is that the BMW will cost less money for general maintenance and repair than the Lexus for at least the first 100,000 miles.  How much less?  Probably not too much, but less is still less.Me personally, I'm waiting to drive the IS and the E90 back to back, and I'll go with the one I like the best.

It is as if use of flowery language and the name is enough to make their cup run over. Reminds of an old chestnut: Guy buys a BMW and drives it OTD, car stops 2 miles later. Owner calls dealer, car is inspected, there is no engine. Owner asks, how did it drive 2 miles? Oh, that would be the reputation, says the dealer, usually gets it so far. Have a nice day folks."

I feel this is in the direction of pride. No one likes to admit cost paid, vs more cost spent to maintain...and it does cost more once it's in shop (vs Asian, US brands). .Ah but because of the all inclusive 4 yr/50k warranty, maintaining a bmw comes down to new tires once a year. If you're gonna keep the car for more than 3-4 years then maintenance costs become an issue with any car.  Then again, if one buys a G/TL, you gotta get oil changes, tune-ups and so forth.  So for the millionth time - because you're beating a dead horse - total cost to maintain of my 330i - $2000 over two years.  All spent on tires."
3475,"June 21, 2005  4:40PM",potemkin,"One thing I still don't see many people admitting, is BMW, Benzes, and Audi's low reliability and high cost of maintenance.I bought a BMW 318ti in August of 1995 and drove it daily for 9-1/2 years putting 112,000 miles on the odometer.  In that time I had one (1) mechanical failure -- the ignition switch went out and need to be replaced.  I think it cost me something like $275.00, I forget.I'm sorry, but it would be disingenuous for me to confess to reliability problems I haven't had.  I'm not saying that BMW's are problem free (no car is), it's just that reliability ratings can be misleading.  Just because it says that the average maintenance cost of a BMW is X amount of dollars, doesn't mean that everyone who buys one is going to wind up spending that amount.  I'm sure there is someone out that bought one just like mine that has sworn off BMW forever after the gazillionth trip to the repair shop, but I'm not that guy.  Quit accusing us lying just because we won't reinforce your preconceived notions of German car reliability.Besides, if you look at the numbers closely, it appears that the odds of buying a unreliable new car in the US is pretty slim no matter what make you buy."

I drove the E90 330i, G35, and A4 3.2 quattro on a closed course in Atlanta last Friday. I had driven a similar Lexus event a year ago. Told my professional race car driver instructor to tell me to keep it down if I was too aggressive. He never said boo - but I figured I was braking at the proper time when his foot hit the passenger floor board at the same time mine went for the brake.Observations (all cars were automatics):A4 - Heavy and understeering. Must be hammered with tires squealing, trusting in the AWD to drag you out of corners.G35 - A ""beast"". Good power and unforgiving handling. Transmission drops back to idle when you come off the gas, leading to delays in getting the power back down.New 330i - An amazingly balanced sport sedan. A smoother ride and more room than my '04. Active steering on an autocross course was telepathic. Brakes, engine, step transmission in sports mode, and suspension all in sync.Did a hot lap with the pro at the wheel - shifted the BMW's steptronic transmission manually and left it in second and followed the line - woohoo!Feed back on MY driving - needed to use the FULL width of the course side to side for the most speed through the cones. I also tended to either go full throttle or braking vice a graduated release of the throttle / application of the brakes as the steering input comes in and then the reverse as it comes out.A great experience to drive all three cars all out at a slow speed (50ish) autocross limit on a 1 mile closed course.Anyone else done this?"

But not necessarily more balanced. Subaru's eat FWD cars for lunch at rallys. Look at the Mini-Cooper, of course it is a niche vehicle with little use for a family of 4, but it drives great.You can take an E90 and drop a V8 in it, like the rumored new M3 and then it's a different story. You will still have a balanced sport sedan that will get to 60. In what 5 or less seconds and do 179 or so without even breathing hard. How about dropping a V8 in a TSX and then running it on a racetrack? Think it will be balanced, or it will be able to even keep up with an M3? Now I'm just using that as an example.So yes in certain situations FWD may be preferable, in certain limited types of races/rallyes/event it may even do very well against RWD vehicles with limited torque and hp."

3542,"June 24, 2005  1:48AM",frisconick,"Here is CRs report on the TLs driving experience by professional drivers:The TL's firm ride is well-controlled, with good isolation from bumps. The highway ride is steady, and the cabin is very quiet. The wide turning circle is one of the few negatives. The Acura feels taut and responsive in cornering, with well-contained body lean. The nicely weighted steering is communicative and quick. In emergency-handling tests, the TL demonstrated good tire grip and cornering balance, and it proved secure in our avoidance maneuver, where it posted a quick 52.5-mph. Powered by a smooth 270-hp, 3.2-liter V6, the TL is noticeably quicker than many of its competitors. Even with such high horsepower, the car was largely devoid of torque steer, a tendency for the front wheels to briefly pull the vehicle off its intended line under strong acceleration (common in front-wheel-drive cars). The engine is coupled with a smooth and responsive five-speed automatic transmission. The TL gets a respectable 23 mpg overall and meets Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle standards, which means that it is 50 percent cleaner than the average 2004 model. Braking was very good.   :P"

It really does not cost all that much more to manufacture say a 5-series over a 3-series, but since the price tag on the 5-series can be a lot higher, there is a lot more profit in it for the company. That's also why the car companies are in love with selling $50K SUVs -- that's where most of their profits come from.But keep in mind that, for many of us, one person's ""entry level"" car is another person's ""ideal"" car.

Driving on the freeway at 80 mph (my usual highway cruise speed) in sixth gear you get 2.5 - 3 k rpms. I can even drive at 40 mph in sixth gear on a relatively flat road without having the engine complain. I kind of wished 6th gear was taller so I could get better gas mileage cruising on the freeway. Oh well. Of course this shorter gearing is better for performance because you can use more gears when accelerating. Also a shorter sixth gear means you dont have to shift down if you want to pass some one on the freeeway. So I think this is a better choice after all. But the G is definately not one of those german cars with a super tall sixth gear made for cruising at 100 mph."

I still get over 30 mpg running 85-90 all day in my BMW but I still wish the car's 6th gear was even taller.  I bought a manual to control the car...:D"
3606,"July 17, 2005  7:41PM",nyrefugee,"You have a point, it almost seems that the Japanese engineers assumed that americans follow speed limits when deciding on the g35 gearing (big mistake). So if you want max fuel efficiency on the highway you will probably have to drive the speed limit (around 65 mph). But as I said above there is a bright side -- more shifting fun at lower speeds."
3607,"July 17, 2005 10:58PM",lmacmil,"For some reason (better top gear acceleration I suppose), Infinitis are geared lower than pretty much all the competition.  Look at any rpm at 60 mph figures in the car mags, the the G35 and M35 are spinning about 500 rpm higher than the competition.  I think this is what kills the highway mileage compared to say a TL."

I'm a former owner of a '00 ES300 and '02 ES300. I *absolutely* loved the prestige of driving a Lexus. The color combo of the '00 was graphite/black and the '02 was gold/cream. I definitely prefer the black interior and I have quite honestly been spoiled with the luxury convenience features like heated seats, passenger control climate, moonroof, speed controlled volume, etc. The '02 had a Nav system, rain sensor wipers, and more bells and whistles than I could imagine but the radical change in body style reminded me too much of a Camry and I would prefer s distinct style in my vehicle. (I actually walked up to a Camry on several occasions thinking it was mine).   So now I'm looking at the '02 or '03 GS430 (I like the luxury sport sedan combo), the '04 G35 and the '04 or '05 Acura TL. I'm hearing great things about the Nav system in the TL which is not a need but a definite desire. Some of the things that I have not experienced but would like to have are: -Bluetooth capability (I didn't have a Bluetooth capable phone when I had the '02) -Steering wheel controls for radio/cd -DVD/CD Player -Voice commands for Nav -Traffic guidance for Nav (I hear these last 2 items are features of the TL's nav system)  Oh and my price range is low 30's.  Yes, I know I want the world. (But what's a single female with no children to do these days besides splurge on herself before she's unable to do so?) I'm not sure I want to give up driving a Lex but I just might have to. Any thoughts?"

Better tranny, better workmanship than a 3 by a long shot.  But also less powerful, rides too high, has a 4 cylinder and it's got power going to the wrong wheels.  If i had to spend 26k on a car, the TSX is a strong contender.  If I've got 35k, the 330i wins without a fight."

3622,"July 19, 2005  4:09AM",blueguydotcom,An 04 TL is nearly two model years old. 06s are two months away...so 24-30k miles is normal.
3623,"July 19, 2005  1:04PM",ljwalters1,"I'll have to weigh in on the side of the TL - here's some general comments (no particular order), and I include a little scoring system (+1 for 1st, 0 for 2nd, -1 for 3rd) that's really just for my own fun.:1.  RIDE QUALITY.  As far as ride quality, I'd guess you prefer a cushier, luxurious ride to a sporty, tight ride.  The used GS430 your considering would probably have the best ride, but with all the high-tech features you want, the TL would probably be a good compromise between comfort, price and features.  The G35 has the most sporty, probably least forgiving ride of the 3. (GS 1; TL  0; G35 -1)2.  STATUS.  I think Acura has the least status among Lexus, Infiniti and Acura.  I think Lexus is #1 of those 3, so the GS has it here, too.   (GS 2; TL -1; G35 -1)3.  FEATURES.  The used GS isn't going to be the most technologically advanced.  Of the 3 cars you might be considering, the TL has it hands down, with all the features you mentioned except for traffic navigation (only in the RL & maybe the Infiniti M) and a video player.  You'll also have to say goodbye to rain-sensing wipers (something I sorely miss from my last car).  The voice-recognition of the TL's nav and its integration with climate control and the radio is utterly amazing!!!  I cannot understate this (you can be driving and just verbally tell the car to change the temp, pass temp only, direct air through particular vents, etc.  You can scroll through your presets, and when there's nothing on the radio, direct the cd player to play any particular track on any particular disc - it's awesome!!!!).  As an aside, the Infiniti M, which is out of your price range and might be too rough a ride, has the best technological features of any car I know.  If it came with a manual transmission, it'd be my dream car.  Another bonus to the TLs nav is that it's a touch-screen, which makes entering info manually much easier than otherwise, and you can enter info while in motion.  My parents Lexus does not allow this.  I don't know about the G35s nav, but, in general, I think the G35 is the least technically advanced of the 3, but a new G would have it over an onlder Lexus, I think. (GS 1; TL 0; G35 -1)PRICE.  I'm not checking the classifieds for you, but I know that to get all the tech features you want, it'll add much more to the GS, since it'll probably need to be aftermarket, if it can be done at all, and it'll cost the least extra on the TL b/c it's all included, except the nav, which is pretty common.  Depending on the changes made on the '06 models, you might be willing to save even more $$$ by buying a used TL or G35. (GS 0; TL 1; G35 -1)Anyway, my scoring has the TL ontop (no surprise - it's what I drive), but disregarding the scoring for a sec, you need to discount the BMW & G35 b/c they value sportiness over luxury, and you seem to prefer luxury.  The GS has it in luxurious ride and prestige; the TL has it in technology.  I think your choice comes down to those two, and will depend on which you value more.PS - I think a guy will be more impressed by a TL than a GS.  As a single gal, that might play into things a bit."
3624,"July 19, 2005  4:57PM",perunest,"The past two season Bill Auberlin won the Touring car national championship in a BMW 325. This year he's down in cumulative points because he's only raced a few events, since he is also racing in other type events. He won the last Touring car race at Lime Rock Park a few weeks ago.     Comparing these highly tuned machines is not an indicator of which is faster. Each car has weight added  (or taken out) based on how well they did in the previous race. If you win two races in a row, you get weight added each time. They intentionally try to level the field to make it competitive for the fans.      Front wheel drive or rear wheel drive is a personal preferance, but more people who like to drive spiritedly choose rear wheel drive (and a manual transmission). The current issue of Automobile Magazine compares what they call the best sports sedans from three continents. They selected the Cadillac CTV from the US, the BMW 330i from Europe, and the Infiniti G35 from Asia. They made a point about leaving out a very good Acura TL, because it was not rear wheel drive and therefore not a ""true sports sedan"". I've owned alot of cars over the years, including a number of front wheel drive models. Nothing could touch my two Miatas for handling (the Miata has 6 consecutive national championships in autocross). I currently drive a 2005 Infiniti G35 6 speed and a 2002 BMW Z3 3.0i 5 speed roadster. Rear wheel drive has a different feel to it. You either like it or you don't."

3630,"July 21, 2005  7:30PM",delmar1,"Based upon your requirements...the 2005 TL is my recommendation (and which I own).  Why I would recommend? If you enjoy the luxury of a Lexus, then the TL has the mix for you. The interior is definitely superior to the G35...and will remind you of the Lexus GS series. It even rivals my 2004 BMW 7 series.  Features....it has all the items you have indicated. Bluetooth...controls, etc. If you order them through the G35...you are looking to add $7k above the TL through a package.  Stereo...6 CD indash changer...with 8 speakers with universally accepted superior performance. Controlled with buttons on the steering wheel.  Dual climate zones. Power seats. All the features you indicated are included in the model without any premium packages to buy.  Performance...well it has 270 hp and the latest Car and Driver magazine shows that it can easily keep up with the BMW 3 series. Past reviews from others show a very competitive performance to others in its class.  As for pricing...you can get a non-navigation TL for about $30.5k...nav for about $32k. G35...$37k+ with horrible 16MPG in mixed driving. Get a similarily equiped BMW 3 series...pay $48k. Lexus GS...pay $50k+.  If you really want something different...look at the TL in Dark Green exterior with the Parchment or Camel interior...which will have wood trims included at no cost. That is sharp and similar to the Lexus interior.  So yes...you can have the world! And you will never pine to drive your Lex again"
3631,"July 21, 2005  7:57PM",laydi,Duly noted and tahnks again for the heads up on the pricing.
3632,"July 21, 2005  8:44PM",quasiactuary,Where on earth do you get $37k+ for a G35?  Invoice on a G35 without navigation (to be apples-to-apples with your TL price) is $29k ....add the premium package and you're up to $32k.  Invoice on a stripped TL is $30.2k.  Your pricing information is pretty biased and not true at all.
3633,"July 21, 2005  8:56PM",blueguydotcom,"And with incentives right now on the 05s, a G35 is a good 2k lower than sticker WITHOUT negotiating."
3634,"July 21, 2005  9:03PM",delmar1,"Allow me to support the $37k+ pricing for a G35...as I have been challenged by another to substantiate..  A base G35 6mt coupe is $33,350.  Add in the premium package ($2450), Navigation ($2000), XM radio ($400 a must if you are going to compare to the TL), splash guards ($210), plus destination ($610).  Total MSRP = $39,020.Quotes I received a month ago were at $37k+.  Perhaps I could have negotiated pricing further down...but I determined the TL was for me.To substantiate my claims...go to the ""G35 prices paid and buying experiences"".  Review recent posts #2625 and #2627.  Pricing of $37,030 and $37,700 respectively.Where you got $29k for a non-navigation G35 I do not know..as the base msrp is already $33k without any premium package.  A stripped down version with nothing...no sunroof...nothing....when the original poster was one that required amenities and in order to compare to the TL. Am I biased and not true?  I hope to be correct in my assessment.  Let me know if I am incorrect in my pricing calculations and whether the pricing posted above are incorrect."
3635,"July 21, 2005  9:23PM",laydi,"Re: the 29K for non-Navi.  Here's a quote from a dealer's email that I received today:Invoice on a TL with Navi is $32,555 and TL without Navi is $30,734. I could save you a little more money, but cannot do an invoice deal. The fact that the 2006's will be out in a couple of months doesn't really help us,because most dealers in the area including ourselves will be out of 2005's before they start coming in.And just FYI- another dealer that did not have my color combo said this...No but the market is soft so you should be able to get the car and a low price just about anywhere.Though he did not quantify ""low price""."

3637,"July 21, 2005 10:59PM",delmar1,"The pricing I provided is 'paid' price to 'paid' price.  Not ""shopped"" price to sticker price as you suggested.As I indicated...go look at the 'prices paid' at both boards and you will see (I even provided specific post numbers for the GS showing prices paid by others at $37k ).  As for the TL pricing (which includes destination costs)...you just have to head over to the TL prices paid board to validate.  Even if you don't head over...look at the quote the original poster 'laydi' just received (I believe an initial $32.2k for nav and $30.7 for non-nav) and posted in a message #3903 above.Yours is apples and oranges as Carsdirect is not what is the going rate and not certain if it even includes destination charges....as once again...look at what people have been paying on the boards here.

3638,"July 22, 2005  1:11AM",frisconick,"I would still recomend the TL for laydi because it seems that she prefers features rather than performance The TL is fine performing machine, and is actually faster than the G35 sedan. So if laydi wants features, lux and performance, the TL is the car."
3639,"July 22, 2005  2:58AM",delmar1,"Still think I am misleading?  My apologies...but let me mention a few items to clearify that my intent was not to mislead.First...most likely than not...when people think of G35..they think of the coupe and the sedan is a secondary thought.  Therefore...I priced the coupe.  I hope I supported my pricing of $37,000 for the G35 Coupe 6mt in my previous note.  I think all will agree to the prices paid as demonstrated on the board postings on this web site.  The $37k is fact.As for the price of the G35 sedan...I did not specifically get a pricing.  However I understand that it is roughly about $35.5k.  I believe compared to the TL w/nav of $32.2k which was demonstrated by 'laydi' email quote from the dealer.Second paragraph.  Yes...I did not bargain further on the G35 as I disclosed in my initial note.  However...once again...the pricing I provided is pricing paid by others on the board...after negotiations.  Please refer to the messages on the board which I referred to...those are actual paid prices ($37k for a G35 6mt coupe).  I did not make them up.  $37k...fact once again.So let me summarize.  Most think of the G35 as a coupe.  The G35 6mt coupe with Nav is selling for $37k according to multiple postings on this web site's board.  The G35 sedan is approximately $35.5k.  These prices compares to Acura TL which is being initially quoted to a prospective buyer at $32.5k...with a likely purchase price of ~$32k after negotiations.  All in all...forget the discussion of the pricing.  Look towards my initial email today which goes over the various amentities of the TL...and how it addresses 'laydi' initial email which communicates her wants and desires in a car....she wants the world.  The TL should be considered."

Re-read my message #3902 and you will see.Those people aren't very good at what they're doing.  The G35 6mt with navi, xm, premium and splash guards (what blazes is that?) is listed for 33k on carsdirect.com.  I'd expect any infinit dealer would beat that by $200-500.  There's a $2000 manufacturer to dealer incentive on the G35.  That means, get the price to $200 over invoice (what one should pay for a car this old) and then subtract another $2k from the price.  that's the target.  of course 200-500 is more realistic.And if you can't get a dealer to let you in on the $2k, that dealer isn't worth going to."

No more. I have to agree (imo) with the statement made in the post.... 'the TL is clearly a better overall vehicle than the G35 Sedan'.

3650,"July 22, 2005  3:21PM",kdshapiro,"""'the TL is clearly a better overall vehicle than the G35 Sedan'.""Depends on what your looking for. The G35 sedan will mop the floors in performance against the TL. If you take these cars to the racetrack you will see the difference. You cannot see the difference on the streets or in the cones or on the skidpad.

That difference is felt on the streets.On one hand you can't talk performance, on the other hand you can't say what will happen on a racetrack doesn't count because they are street cars.That said the TL handles good enough for you.

The car was only $10k more than a V-6 Accord and less than $5k more than either the TL or the G35. To me - worth it. Still, the smaller engined 325i outsold the 330i by 6 to 1, so price does make a difference, even for the average BMW consumer.I really like the TL - a very nice car - good-looking, fast, comfortable, a beautiful interior, and all the high tech done right.I also like the G35, particularly with a manual transmission. It has ""V-8 like"" power and good brakes. The automatic transmission is the weakest link in the G35 sedan.I think the GS300 and 430 are in another class all together and compete against the 5 series BMW and the Acura RL. The Lexus equivalent is the updated IS250 and 350. I'm still waiting to check those two out. The old IS handled fine, but was a bit gaudy for my taste.I still think the TL is the one for the lady, as it nicely bridges the gap between her soft, luxurious ES300 and the  G35. A little more sport than what she drove before, but not the whole hog of the G35."
3662,"July 22, 2005 10:06PM",nyrefugee,"""The G ""Base"" sedan has no amentities and is not comparable. Need to upgrade with the premium package and sports suspension package.""Ok I really do not like flame wars, but since some people may actually use these forums to make a car buying decision I feel like I should disagree with this statement. The G base actually has a lot of features. Power leather heated seats six cd in dash changer with mp3, adjutsable wheel with telescoping, adjustable rear seats, power window and mirrors, side and curtain airbags, xenon lights etc. Not as much features as the accord of course but enough that you are not really missing anything. And as such it is 2k cheaper than the base acord. If you insist that the premium package is necessary for comparison then the g35 is about 1.5 k more expensive. And no the G35 does not need the performance package to compare with a base accord. The G35 multilink suspension is more advanced than the acura double wishbone one. Also the G35 uses aluminum in its suspension elements I am not sure if the acura does (they dont mention it, which probably means they use steel). In any event the g35 will handle better even if you do not consider the acura's fwd. And the problems with the fwd have already been beaten to death in these forums. So in conclusion a standard suspension g35 will handle better than the standard TL suspension. On top of everything else if you get the manual tranny you get the performance package standard as well. So then you have to add the 18 inch wheels to the tl in order to make it comparable. So the G35 with the premium package will be about the same price as a comparable tl with the 18 inch wheels. I cannot give exact numbers here because the 18 inch wheels on the TL require unspecified dealership installation charges. So in summary:g35 auto vs TL auto = TL is 1.5 k cheaperg35 manual vs TL manual = about the same priceIn these packages the TL has some more features and better interior while the G35 has more powerful engine and better handling. There you go."
3663,"July 22, 2005 10:33PM",delmar1,I am getting out of this discussion.   But since people may be making educated buying decisions...let me list a few things included in the 'premium package' ... many features which are already included in the TL pricing...but which require additional costs to upgrade from a base G35:Sunroof. Premium audio system with 7 speakers.Driver's seat memory with entry/exit assist. Steering wheel memory. Electrochromic auto-dimming inside mirror. HomeLink® Universal Transceiver.

I am a female and an educated professional in her early 30s who happen to drive a TL.  I have driven grocery haulers (Camry) to a Mercedes SLK.  And I select the TL for many reasons.  Not because I am odd.  Or I am masculine.  And I do not scare men off with my car.As for whether I drive like a 'lady' as another here suggest that the TL drivers are....shame on you.  How narrow minded.  You must drive alone a lot.As a point of reference for the original poster 'laydi'...the TL was purchased because the TL is the best value out there.  It is well balanced between sports and luxury.  It has all the supple luxury you would expect from a Lexus as you have driven.  It has leading edge technology such as bluetooth.  It has the amenities that can impress.  It is a pleasurable car to entertain with.  The performance is fun and exciting (forget all the discussions here of 0-60 times and the thought that aluminum in the suspension makes for a superior car) (I doubt many that slam here haven't even test driven the TL).  Are the above attributes of why I purchased my car only valued by females?  I doubt.  Just as not all males measure their cars by 0-60 times but by other attributes.  As for a lot of these recent postings, these are my thoughts.  The people in the G35 camp....they are sports purists and are slanted more towards the 'sports-luxury'.  The TL contingency is slanted more towards the 'luxury-sports'.  Who is right?  Nobody.  If you do wish to beat up on each other...there is the ""Acura TL vs G35"" board.

3705,"July 24, 2005  4:21AM",odessit,"what do long time followers of 3 series design and performance think about latest iteration of 3I think that the new 3 style looks more feminine. I refer to my 06 325 as “she” , like “my girl”  The previous body style is sharper, more masculine. In my eyes old body style of 3 is like arrow – you look at it and it really looks fast, fast like and arrow. I guess I am just in love with bimmers:) But everything changes; bmw simply could not afford to stay behind and not to change body style while other manufactures do so. And in my opinion new style is very good, its still bmw; it’ll just take time to get used to it.TL is a VERY nice and sharp looking car. It is really a matter of preference who likes what – TL or 3. Both are awesome styles. Before I thought of buying TL, but then I said to myself – no, I’ll spent a bit more $ but get what I always wanted. But still –TL is a very sharp and fast looking car. Really distinctive design, not like other cars.G35 – sorry, in my opinion it does not look good. At least no comparison to TL or 3 styles. Drove G35 just a few days ago. Power is the only thing worth mentioning. Design –inside and exterior – far from perfect to my taste. No offence to all owners of G. Perfect engine, MUCH faster than my 325. mike"

3716,"July 24, 2005  2:18PM",chris65amg,"However, it's amazing that BMW is still able to hold the small luxury/sport sedan crown. The fact that the competition has caught up is mostly because they are trying to implement a lot of the same ideas. Look at the last IS300. I don't think that the I-6 was a mistake.... look at the G35. Infiniti took almost an American approach, viz more horsepower. They've been trying for years and years. If they didn't start putting the heat on, then I'd be worried. It's not that the 3-Series isn't the best drive, or that it isn't the most fun, it's just that BMW got a little out of hand with the pricing. Bring it down a few K's, and they'll be raving again.Hmm. Time for my styling critique. 3-Series: the older ones look aggressive. Kind of like they'll jump out and take a hunk out of a passerby's leg. The curvier shape of the new one looks a little blobby. Still a hell of a drive, though.G35: suffers from what I call ""lack of style"": namely that it doesn't have a lot going on, especially from the side view, where it looks rather like a loaf of bread. That's the coupe. The sedan looks classier, especially in black, but still not a heart-stopper. CTS: No comment  :P IS: Talking about the new one. It looks classy, but kind of boring. Not in a bad way, but it looks like a Lexus. Better than the G35  or CTS, but I honestly think that the  TL looks better. Or rather, it's a mood thing. The TL is the wacky little sister who listens to new age, and the IS is the adult sis who listens to soft rock.TL: a little crazy, but it works. I like the fact that Honda took a styling chance when they didn't have to. Kudos. I like the way it looks weird. This car, however, does not look as good in black as most of the others, probably since a nice silver would accentuate its creases better.A4:  The front end looks good ( I like the new grille).

It's one of the few cars that truly balances luxury and performance.  She'd get it for the luxury features, including the logical voice-recognition that'd make her car-rides more enjoyable.

You're on a fluffy cloud - say like sitting in my grandpa's park avenue when I was 13. I greatly prefer firm seating.  My couches were custom made so that I sit atop the leather...not down and wrapped up in it.  Same with the leather in bmws/mbs/and audis....sit atop the seat.  Less leg support?  My 330i's lower seat cushion extends to under my thighs nicely.  If you mean lateral leg support, I have no idea what that would feel like.  I'm five-seven and 145 lbs so I can't comprehend jokes about narrow airplane seats or the G35's controls digging into the thigh...I'd have to grow by a factor of two to have my thighs ever touch the lateral thigh supports on any car's seats.Thigh support laterally is about as odd and unfamiliar to ma as the idea of sliding around on leather seats.

You're not sitting on the seat but rather the material's claustrophobically sucking you in and providing zero support.Actually, softer seating provides better support than firm.  I found this out when bed-shopping.  It was pointed out that softer beds that conform to your body are better at supporting your natural arches/curves, whereas firmer beds force your body to conform more to them.Regardless, having switched from a Passat (interior is very similar to Audi) to a TL, I understand what you are saying, and while the TLs seats don't bother me, I agree with your assessment re sitting on the seat v. in the seat.  You might want to check out Cadillac's offerings and see what their seating is like.I don't recall how BMWs seats were, but in general, German cars have firmer seats.  If the price/size ratio (German cars in the same price-range as their Japanese & American counterparts are generally smaller (eg. BMW 3-series, Audi A4 v. TL, G35, CTS)) isn't working for you, you might want to look at the VW Passat.  You'll lose some handling, but the new one should put out about 250/270 hp (you could try to find a used Passat v8, too), and have the seats you prefer.  Again, I'm only suggesting this if the German cars with the seating you prefer and in the entry-level price range are too small."

Also an Evo is AWD and thats why it's so fast it will only top out at 155 or so. A Vette is RWD and can top out at 186 for the C6 and 200 for the new Z06. I doubt a Evo can do that, and I had a 1995 Pontiac Trans Am and I havent died yet. My friend had a Vette when he was 16 but his dad sold it and bought him a 2002 Pontiac Ws-6 and he isn't dead. I'm an American Muscle man but I hate Vipers and Mustangs. But I'm quite fond of Lexus,nissan,and Subaru. I like Acura but the TL was a mistake, it is a 270 H.P. FWD. They put tire that are more wide on the back than the front, plus it has really bad torque steer. The car is pretty though. I like STI but there to showy 300 H.P. but no top speed like the Evo It can handle good and take off good but nothing stands close to thew Vette for the price. I like the STI better than the Evo though. Oh, and go to MotorTrend.com and look up fastest vettes they have a C5 that can hit 0-60 in 1.97 sec. and can top out at 226 MPH."

3769,"August  1, 2005  4:48PM",gordonwd,"The SAE has basically revised the rules on how HP is measured on the dyno to try to make the numbers more realistic. IOW, they try to keep the dyno-geeks from ""cheating"" a bit to get their numbers up. This has already been done in the past. Back in my early days in the industry (1960s), engines were tested on a dyno with everything possible done to maximize the horsepower. This included running with open pipes, no air cleaner, no accessories (i.e. power steering pump or alternator), no fan, etc., etc. If you look at the old HP ratings of 60s and 70s muscle cars, you'll see that 350 - 400HP and more were common ratings. By today's standards, with engines realistically dressed out, these engines would be rated 100 - 150HP lower."
3770,"August  1, 2005  5:02PM",darrenw,"For people in the habit of thinking about SAE net horsepower, or old musclecar enthusiasts accustomed to SAE gross numbers, looking at real-world rear-wheel horsepower can be quite a wake-up call. This 1970 Charger makes an excellent example. Its 318 was factory rated in 1970 at 230 horsepower (SAE gross). But on the dyno it came just short of 150 horsepower (corrected rear-wheel). As a very general rule, rear-wheel horsepower on a manual-transmission car is about 15% less than SAE net, and rear-wheel horsepower on an automatic-transmission car is about 20% less than SAE net."
3771,"August  4, 2005  6:30PM",geebee4,"I'm also thinking of switching from a Passat to TL; what was your experience with the TL? The BMW 325i is tempting, but I always go with the practical car and reliability is important. The 2006 Passat sounds good, also; too many decisions."
3772,"August  4, 2005  9:55PM",taxesquire,"I love my TL, and I never regret switching from a Passat to a TL.  That being said, let me be nitpicky.  1stly, I had a Passat GLX 5MT.  Meaning it was a 6 cyl engine with all the amenities standard.  I now have a 6MT TL w/ Nav.I believe the Passat is gonna have about 250 hp, so it's #s will be comparable to the TL, and it might even have more low-end torque, it could be faster 0-30.  No way the Passat will handle as well as the TL, though, making the TL a lot more fun to drive.  Both interiors are well done - the TL seems a notch above, even though the Passat had real wood and the TLs is fake.  If you're going manual transmission, the TLs is by far more enjoyable.  I love the early clutch engagement and it shifts very smoothely.As far as luxury features that I use, it's pretty close.  The TLs nav makes it much, much better than the Passat, IMO.  But if you're comparing non-nav vehicles, other than a 6-disc changer, I'm not sure what luxury features the TL has that the Passat doesn't.  One is that the TLs lights shut-off automatically.  Also, I like that the TL doesn't have a loud ""ding"" to let you know you're low on fuel.  I'd often find myself driving where the tank is just at the cutoff level and the light would go on and off, dinging each time.  I also like the TLs auto-a/c better.  For some reason, the Passat's would always be 1 level too strong for me.  The 1 thing that drove me crazy about the Passat was the steering wheel radio controls.  The buttons should be on the left and the station changer should scroll the presets - VW got it backwards.Here are some things I miss from the Passat:  the key integrated fob (TL uses a separate FOB and regular key); electric fold-in mirrors; rear sunshade; rain-sensing wipers.  Also, the Passat had nicer computer controls b/c (1) there were 2 sets of settings (TL has 1); (2) you didn't need to take your hand off the wheel to scroll through the options; (3) the Passat gave you more info on each screen; (4) the TL makes you hit a ""display"" button to display mpg, ave mph, etc.As far as differences that aren't good or bad, the Passat's seats are more firm, the TL's are softer.Frankly, from what I'v heard of the '06 Passat, it might be a tough deciding between the 2, but I'd expect the TL to give you a better value b/c Passats will probably go for MSRP initially.To sum up, if you have a top-of-the-line Passat and enjoy it, but want something a tad more luxurious and a lot more sporty, you'll love the TL.  If you're all about comfort and convenience, but won't get the nav, it might be close, and there will be some things you miss about the Passat.Hope this helps!!! Sorry it's so long."

This is because the FM platform is really solid, and the coupe bodystyle further reverses flex. You can read reviews of the g35 and the 350z (which has the fm platform as well) and most of them, even one review that slammed the 350z say that the FM platform was great and allowed no chasis flex or squirm. As I said that has been my experience as well, especially now that I am driving the car in the pothole filled streets of LA I find that the chasis does not twist and squirm even when i hit the big potholes. It is possible that the car you drove had something disconnected or lose that made noise, which sounded like chasis flex. The problem is that the FM platform is made out of steel, so it makes the car comparatively heavy. It is not that heavy compared to other cars of its class, but it is a pig compared to small sports cars, i.e. s2000s and miatas. The G35 would so much better if its body was made of aluminum but I am sure that would make it much more expensive too. ""And in the G35c outward vision is compromised too much.""That is only true in the back. And you can get good vision in the back if you are very careful about setting up your side mirrors. But I admit, this car definately needs bigger mirrors. ""perfect comfort, poise, power, handling, reliability.""For me the G has everything sans the comfort. The comfort is not perfect due to the hard suspension (I have a coupe with all suspension packages). But it is not easy for a car with good handling to have perfect comfort. Actually, it i pretty much impossible. But th G coupe is very comfortable for a car that handles the way it does."

Dont be confused by the 300 hp engine ... the IS 350 will not be a sports or ""sporty"" car because no lexuses are. The LExus strategy is luxury and isolation from the environment. That is exactly the opposite as a sports car which must strive to make you one with the road. So I am not at all surprised they do not offer a manual. They are just not selling to the sports car buyer. They are selling to the person that feels good about having a 300 hp car, but does not drive it hard or care about how it handles, rather he/she cares mostly about the luxury.

Can you say torque converter?xSGs are the perfect medium.For those who are interested in maximum control of the cars manual or SMGs are the way to go.
3852,"August 18, 2005  3:23PM",fedlawman,"""discussing 0-60 under 7 being a requirement for any car being considered remotely sporty.""I thought he said, ""In my eyes if a car costs over 30k, it better do 60 in less than 7 seconds."" Agree with him or not, that's a pretty clear statement of his opinion - and one that didn't mention anything about a requirement for sportiness."
3853,"August 18, 2005  3:27PM",kdshapiro,"It's not about what the driver can do, it's about what the car can do. So I'm not sure of your point. Autos vs trannies are an individual preference. The amount of fine tuning a driver has over a car is best with a manual, but the driver does more work. But in the end the driver can only do what the car is capable of doing."
3854,"August 18, 2005  3:34PM",fedlawman,"I think you misunderstood what blueguy was saying.He has stated in other posts that he holds cars like the Miata and TSX in high regard. Both are ""sporty cars"" that post 0-60 numbers above 7 seconds. But they also cost less than $30,000.$30,000 is simply a line he has personally drawn in the sand. In a day when cars are as powerful and quick as they are today, it's not unreasonable to desire a $30,000 vehicle that achieves certain benchmarks.Would you not be a little embarassed when you stomp the go pedal at a fresh green light in your brand new $33,000 slush box 325i and the Honda Odyssey next to you (with 2 kids watching ""Shrek 2"" in the back) pulls ahead and changes lanes in front of you???"
3855,"August 18, 2005  3:42PM",blueguydotcom,"What's the joy in 0-60 drag racing?? If there is none to begin with how can any be taken out? Bluedotcomguy and were discussing 0-60 under 7 being a requirement for any car being considered remotely sporty.Uh-uh.  I never mentioned sporty.  I simply called slower to 60 cars that cost over 30k dogs.   If your argument is that straitline performance is not as relevent as handling, you are actually in my corner.I want both.  Yeah a gen 1 miata in the twisties was a hoot.  But you and I both know that same car with 200 more hp would have been absolutely exhilirating.  hit a tight 270 degree 15 mph corner and with a manual and a decent engine, I'm going to be a happy camper.  Cost to fun ratio.  I can snatch up a new miata loaded for 24-25k.  That'll put a grin a on my face because it doesn't cross that imaginary line of 30k."
3856,"August 18, 2005  3:49PM",taxesquire,"Now that most autos in this category are 5 and 6 speed automatics, it wouldn't surprise me if pedal-to-the-metal on a straightaway, they were faster than their manual cousins due to human limitations, though tests don't seem to show that as being the case.  I feel confident that a 5 speed automatic would be clearly faster than a manual of the same car driven by myself. :blush:   But taking out the human error is what makes the car less sporty.It's not so much whether you can lay out the dough to buy a fast car - it's whether you personally can make any particular car operate at its best, regardless of whether that means keeping rpms down to stretch every last ounce of gas or running right up to the redline.  I'd think I'd get more satisfaction out of maximizing the HP in a manual 4 cylinder Honda Accord than just slamming my foot down on an automatic Porsche Boxter.Think about Nascar - the argument that it's not a sport is based on the fact that it mainly involves machines, and the best machine will win.  Pro-Nascar arguments revolve around the human interaction - when to slow down, when to accelerate, when to block an opposing car, the pit crew, etc.  Automatics take a level of involvement out of the equation and lessen the ""sport"" of the whole thing."
3857,"August 18, 2005  3:52PM",brightness04,"Not sure why you are addressing that to me.  Are you saying a person merging onto an expressway from a red light will be able to shift faster than he/she otherwose would be able to do?  I don't get it.  The discussion was never about manual vs. automatic, but whether the published automatic rating or mnual rating for 0-60 is more relevent to what most owners actually get.  Almost no one can  shift a manual as fast as SMG (dah, that's why they invented SMG in racing); few can shift manual faster than a modern automatic for that matter.  Therefore what people actually get from their car are closer to the car's automatic 0-60 rating, not the manual rating when driven by professional drivers.  Whether manual or automatic is better for personal taste is entirely a different story altogether, depending on your driving condition etc.."
3858,"August 18, 2005  4:31PM",kdshapiro,I would be embarrassed if that were to occur also. Thankfully today it wouldn't.
3859,"August 18, 2005  6:45PM",brightness04,"I would be embarrassed if that were to occur also. Thankfully today it wouldn't. Really??  V6 Accord is a lot faster than 325Ci, the ""sport coupe,"" especially off the line."
3860,"August 18, 2005  7:22PM",ivorypearlg,"My mistake I am sorry I should have paid more attention to where I was getting the info from but for the most part they are pretty close numbers. The Volvo S60R does NOT go 0-60 in 5.4 with the auto but it is in the low 6's I would guess having 300Hp, even with the torque cut out on 1st and 2nd gears. Uh, do you think SAAB will ever make a worthy sport sedan ?"
3861,"August 18, 2005  7:29PM",gordonwd,"I read an interesting explanation the other day about why mag testers such as C&D can usually get better 0-60 times that the manufacturer's rating. It has to do with exactly how the measurement is taken. Apparently, most of the magazines use a technique that was developed by the NHRA (the drag racing sanctioning body), where they start the timer when the car has moved one foot -- not at the exact instant of when it starts to move. Now you might ask how big a deal one foot is, but you would be surprised how long that takes -- it is of course the slowest one foot of the entire run, especially considering what it takes to overcome the inertia of geting the car to start moving.As another example, I used to drive a front-engine dragster that would run the 1/4-mile in about 7.5 seconds. One time, though, I popped the front wheels so that they went over the starting beams and I started the timers with my rear wheels instead of the front wheels. So I basically got a 170"" head start on the clock. My elapsed time on that run was 6.8 seconds, which would have been good for a world record if it had been a legitimate time!"
3862,"August 18, 2005  7:33PM",ivorypearlg,Also about the 0-60 times 5.6 seconds for what the 6-spd manual 330I ? Well in the new comparo in the Automobile mag says that the New 2006 BMW 330I 6-SPD does 0-60 in 6.1sec... That is slower then the Infiniti G35 6-SPD going 0-60 in 5.8 sec. Then the last one was with the 6-SPD Caddy CTS moving 0-60 in 6.5 sec.
3863,"August 18, 2005  7:53PM",kdshapiro,"You know what, you can cite all the comparos in the world, it doesn't change the basic fact the Infiniti with a bigger engine, more hp and torque cannot really outgun the 330i. So you can cite this comparo, I'll cite the other comparo."
3864,"August 18, 2005  7:54PM",kdshapiro,Really? You think? You should see them race. Unfortunately I have. Accord loses. Mine is faster than both of them anyway.
3865,"August 18, 2005  7:58PM",kdshapiro,"Some mags pop the clutch or use torque braking.While the numbers the mags get usually are representative of the best times you could achieve, you will rarely hit those numbers unless you wish to damage your drivetrain.I think though it's important that each mag sticks with their established method, so one can compare times.However, I would never do a full torque brake launch with my auto tranny."
3866,"August 18, 2005  8:03PM",ivorypearlg,"Um... face the 6-SPD Infin will blow the doors the god darn BMW 330I, but then BMW has one thing Infiniti dont the M-Class"
3867,"August 18, 2005  8:04PM",03accordman,"kd, no comparo ever has timed a 330 quicker to 60 than a G35.  I agree with you that the G has a bigger engine, more power etc, but the fact remains that the G is quicker to the 330.  And with around a 10k advantage too.  The gas mileage sucks but you gotta pay somewhere."
3868,"August 18, 2005  8:07PM",03accordman,"again, a V6 accord stick would out gun any 325 stick to 60 (not comparing the cars in any manner!).  Accord coupe has been timed in the high 5s to 60 by many magazines/testers."
3869,"August 18, 2005  8:09PM",03accordman,"the Bimmers are not just about 0-60 numbers, more about ride/handling/steering."
3870,"August 18, 2005  8:09PM",ivorypearlg,Wow really I never knew that the V6 Accord Coupe was that fast ? It only has 240Hp doesnt it ?
3871,"August 18, 2005  8:12PM",ivorypearlg,I also think that Infiniti G35 also has great ride handling and steering... The only thing Infiniti lags is a great appointed interior and that German heritage
3872,"August 18, 2005  8:12PM",fedlawman,"The Infiniti, even with almost 50 hp more than the BMW, still manages to be a mere 0.3 secs faster to 60 MPH and through the 1/4 mile?!?!I don't know about you, but I can't tell 0.3 secs from the seat of my pants, and dynamically, the 330i blows the G35 away in terms of ride, steering, and poise. The G35 offers tremendous performance/luxury bang for the buck, but in my opinion, the 330i is the superior drivers car."
3873,"August 18, 2005  8:16PM",ivorypearlg,"Well I think the G has great ride even thou I have a 03 coupe, but when I went in for a scheduled service they gave me a G35X and the ride was great. I also test drove the 330I also good ride handling and overall goodness to put it in short terms. But I also believe that Infiniti did an excellent job on the G and even thou I could go and buy a 750I I wont I am comfy in my G."
3874,"August 18, 2005  8:23PM",potemkin,"Isn't this the point in the conversation where somebody is supposed to mention (wholly outside the context the subject, mind you) the WRX STi?"
3875,"August 18, 2005  8:26PM",ivorypearlg,Is there any Luxury in that WRX STi ? Didnt Saab and Sub merge or somthing ? Hopefully Subaru can give Saab the performance they need.
3876,"August 18, 2005  8:35PM",blueguydotcom,"Wow, it's in the handling the Infiniti really lost me.  Wish the G35 felt more planted to the tarmac.not sure what heritage means regarding cars.  they're just cars.  they exist right now.  i don't believe cars have heritage or cache."
3877,"August 18, 2005  8:39PM",ivorypearlg,LOL my point was trying to be made that people think that German engineered cars are superior to Japanese and american cars !
3878,"August 18, 2005  8:39PM",03accordman,"BMW does seem to manage to do more with less less power.  I read somewhere that the BMW CEO said that they are not going to shy away from the HP war, but it doesn't seem that they are taking that route.  In most segments today, BMWs are lagging behind other makes in HP & Torque figures, though, like i said earlier, they are able to get more out of what they have.I am looking to get a 325 in the near future, and went to take a peek a few days back.  The car looks gorgeous to me, but the rear seat is too small and low for an adult to sit comfortable, and this is a requirement for me.  I will go again this weekend for a second look and then decide."

I will grant you, some mags post impressive times from autos you wouldn't expect.So I amend my statement to read, the BMW will loose them as soon as the other vehicle goes to turn the wheel."
3883,"August 18, 2005  8:50PM",ivorypearlg,So the benchmark 5 does have a bigger engine then the benchmark M I wondered why the 5 was faster. I love the 545 and was going to buy one then saw the interior and it turned me off !
3884,"August 18, 2005  8:50PM",03accordman,"I believe that the 530 is a 3.0L, and the 545 is a 4.5L"

3886,"August 18, 2005  8:53PM",bmwe90,"I purchased an Infiniti G35  :lemon:  soon after they were released. It was in the shop for 69 days within the first 8 months of ownership. Nissan was horrible to deal with in any respect. I like to think of it this way: McDonalds can hype up their hamburgers calling them ""premium"" (like they do everything) and the numbers are there to support it - you get 6 whole oz. of beef - a whole ounce more than the competition. But then you realize the competition is a 5 diamond restaurant offering a burger as well - you can see where I'm going. I recently purchased a new 3 series. It easily makes it way to 100 without the steering wheel shaking as in the G. the wind doesn't whistle through the cut rate seals on the doors as it did in the G, and finally when I brake, I get smooth, modulated pedal action which brings me to a quick stop. In the G, the whole car shook from the severely warped rotors which they tried to fix on more than 5 occasions. So if you value smooth and quick acceleration, a solidly built car, and powerfully smooth brakes, by all means spend the few extra bucks and purchase the 3. If you can live with the fact that you paid almost as much for a car that is manufactured by a company who's claim to fame is the Sentra - and you dont mind cost cutting measures literally surrounding you - choose the G. In defense of the G, It is probably the car that comes the closest to the Bimmer as far as handling, but it has a long, long way to go before many people would choose it over a 3 series."

I think the fact that lexus has only one vehicle which we can really consider ""performance oriented"" while BMW has not only numerous performance oriented vehicles (any of the larger output engines on all series) but several ""super high performance"" vehicles (M3, M5, & M6) indicates that lexus is trying its best to get a foot in the proverbial door.

Yes BMW was around a lot longer then any of the Japanese auto makers but it doesn't make them any better ! Is Mercedes - Benz better because they were the first auto manufactor ? I believe that BMW has more then sweaty palms. Figure Infiniti     GT-R is going to take the M6 and then a high performance version of the M45 with the same TT-450Hp V8 will take the M5. The Infiniti Flagship is holding them back. Then all they need is a couple of convert's and you got yourself a full line up ready to go head to head with BMW. Give it to 2008.

I'm sure you would like to see BMW lose, but it's probably not gonna happen.As far as Mercedes as a car company, they still build the best cars to get in the drivers seat, with the widest variety.

The law firm who handled my lemon law case repeatedly told me that Infiniti was the worst company to deal with.

When it snows he cant drive his 330I so his wife drives him to work in her SAAB 9-5.\Last time at Infiniti a lady was trading in her G sedan for the G35X because she couldn't drive it in the snow. As for me I have the luxury of having 3 cars .
3921,"August 18, 2005 11:27PM",shipo,"""Sorry but my brothers 330I is horrible in the snow !""Uh-hu, not buying.  My bet is that it's not the car it's the tires.  If his 330i is horrible then it has the summer performance tires, which BMW overtly states should not be used in the winter.  If his car does not have the Sport Package and has the OEM All-Season rubber then you are overstating the case.  My first BMW was a 328i with almost identical rubber as a 330i non-SP, and while it wasn't the best car I've ever driven in the white stuff, it was certainly capable of getting from point A to point B with a minimal amount of fuss.  I then got a 530i SP and ""YIKES"", that thing was horrible in even a bare dusting of snow.  Remember I stated ""...it's the tires""?  Well I put a dedicated set of winter skins on my 530i and Presto-Chango, my car went from the worst winter car I've ever driven to the absolute best, FWD cars included.What's that you say?  I don't live in Maine?  You're right, I live in New Hampshire, and over the last three winters we've had over 300 inches of snow.  Through it all my 530i only stayed in the garage when the snow was so deep that it would have been nothing more than a snow plow if I'd taken it out.  That said, six to eight inches of rutted snow was no problem, even with all of the undulating roads (vertically and horizontally) that we have around here.Best Regards,Shipo"

3930,"August 19, 2005  2:21PM",klpeel,"bmwe90, sorry for your bad experience with the initial version of the G35!  I just bought a 2005, and believe that significant improvements were made in the last two model years.  That doesn't excuse the problems you faced, or excuse Infiniti for coming out with the G with so many initial problems (at least with your car), but...  The conversation on the BMW3 vs. G35 is interesting, but really I think the two cars serve (slightly) different targets.  For me, the 3 series was just a little too small and a little too expensive to meet my needs.  If I valued absolute performance over all other considerations, then my choice would have been similar to yours."
3931,"August 19, 2005  3:03PM",jrock65,"I don't think the new 330i ""blows away"" the G in handling, but it is a better handler.With the 330i you get better handling and the BMW badge.With the G35 you get better straight-line performance, more interior room, and about $7000 left over.Of course, nothing beats the Lancer Evolution or the Impreza Sti if you want the most performance for the buck in a sedan."

3934,"August 19, 2005  9:59PM",bmwe90,"If I had to do it over again, I would not have purchased the G35. But if you asked me if i made the logical and practical decision at the time - I would say yes, of course. From what I gather from the many happy G owners on this board, Infinti does, in most cases, provide a great handling, midsize car for a good sum of $ less than BMW's 3 series. If I hadn't had my sour experience with Infiniti, and I were in the market for a sport sedan - and money was a consideration (as it is for most of us) the G would definently be on my shopping list. The higher price of the 3 series does pose a problem for some buyers in this category, and at any rate, the G provides more interior room than even the new 3. I agree with you that these two cars are serving different targets, but those targets aren't too far apart. I did spend 35,000 miles behind the wheel of my G before it was gone. I have spent about 4k miles in my new 3 and the cars each have their strengths - along with very few weaknesses. I will give you guys/gals my honest opinion of each car (I'll pretend for fairness sake that nothing was wrong with my G)The G was very quick with it's 260 hp and torque. The car handled well at nearly all speeds but doesn't match BMW for handling at high speeds (90+). the BMW seems more at home the harder you push it while the Infiniti feels like it's up to the task, but it does it with a straight face while the BMW does it with a smile. The BMW has the better interior hands down, quality wise, I wont comment on style because that very objective. The BMW is a tigher squeeze though, and most taller passengers will be asking the driver and font passenger to move up. It seems once you get situated in the BMW, no one complains from lack of space. The Infinti's rear doors open much much wider than the bimmers, though - and the seats also recline in the G. The engines are a tossup, I think the inline 6 is smoother than the v6 in the infiniti but i will agree that infiniti's v6 is probably the second best engine I have ever owned. The transmission in the BMW has an extra gear and seems to shift smoother and quicker. I had a full size spare in my G and I loved it. I don't like the new run flats on my 3. I prefer the BMWs brakes though. BMW does include maintenance, which is nice- but not a deal maker in any respect.They are both great performers and I think anywho who choses either is getting one of the best sport sedans available in this class."

In that segment 30 mpg on the freeway is viewed as reasonable as the cars also have luxury (absent from a prius), handling (absent from a prius) and power (totally absent from a prius).I have driven an 04 Prius (current body style).  It scared me!  There was a crosswind and that egg-shaped, high-riding car with almost zero tire connection to the road felt like it was going to flip.  Doing 80 on the freeway was a chore and at that speed - normal freeway speed, not even normal long distance drive speed - the gas mileage was less than stellar.  I can only guess how horrid my mileage would be running 95-100 down I-5 to SF ior I-15 to Vegas.  Would it even get in the 30s?I know I can get 30+ running 95-100 in my 330i. And the car feels firmly planeted.  And I'm only using 2/3rds of the engine's potential, so the car still has the gumption to scoot if I need it.

We are talking about 3 to 3.5L 6 cylinder engines that power cars that weigh between 3200/3300 to 3500/3600 (just a guess). At this weight point and engine size there is a reasonable expectation of decent gas mileage if you have the ability to cruise at an even pace down the freeway. There also is an expection of reasonable gas mileage if you live in a congested area like I do. Along with reasonable gas mileage there is an expectation of snappy acceleration and crisp handling.The TL and 3 fulfill the expectation of reasonable gas mileage, and that is where the G falls short relative to these two cars. It's just one of the criteria one looks at when choosing a car."

The manufacturers don't even market them based on the mileage factor. Imagine a BMW ad "".....Get the new 3 series, the most fuel efficient car in it's class"". These cars are Sport Coupes (or Sedan) . Not economy cars. They are about sportiness, that is styling, handling, power, speed, ride, gadgets, and toys. Even at todays gas prices that is how I still see my G35 coupe....even though I walked away from the pump the last time with a sigh I still powered it down the highway after leaving the gas station. I bought my G35 Coupe based on styling, power, ride,  fun to drive, gadgets, falls within my budget. I like myu cars to have a nice interior but I was willing to settle with the interior of the G35 considering all the other plus factors. In addition, every other Joe in my neighbourhood has a 3 series. Now that I am seeing the G35 Coupe everywhere I go I want to change it again, but I would probably go more for a CLK because it has really good features and it is not as popular as some other cars and it wouldn't be for the gas mileage. :confuse:"

The miata's razor sharp handling, impeccable reliability, 30+ freeway mileage and low price (26k loaded - or 24k off the lot) gets my eyebrow to raise.  Maybe the IS350 with auto will be fun.

When I was picking up my ED 530i I spent the first 1,300 miles or so keeping the car under 100 mph, and during that most critical of break in periods I obtained between 26 and 28 mpg.  For the last sprint back into Munich I had the cruise control set at 130 and according to the trip computer I was still getting between 23 and 24 mpg.  Geez, my 530i was getting about the same mileage at a buck thirty that a G35 gets at half that speed.Now, being one that habitually refutes anecdotal evidence, I must admit that over the last seven years of contributing here in the TownHall I seen literally hundreds of posts by BMW 3-Series and 5-Series drivers claiming mileage well beyond the EPA numbers (and precious few that couldn&#146;t).  Once again, in my mind that is significant.  In fact, a few months ago in the 5-Series forum, a contributer was complaining that his E39 530i was barely able to make the EPA numbers.  The rest of us kept maintaining that there was something wrong with his car, contrary to what his dealer was telling him.  I mentioned to him that I was aware that there was at least one round of firmware out of Munich that was, ummm, less than optimal, and suggested that he have his OBC reflashed.  Bingo!  He immediately started getting mileage more in line with what the rest of us had been telling him he should be experiencing, which by the way was well beyond the EPA numbers.Best Regards,Shipo"

We hear can ignore fact that Nielsen predicts the habits of 35million people from 1000 peopleThere is a percentage of people who will hit the EPAs number because they drive the car exactly as it was tested.

I posted this on over on the Mercedes boards (because that's where I started in research) - but after scanning for a while, found all the other boards - and THIS one is where I should have posted.   Anyway... looking back, this board has a good balanced sense for these type of questions:Right now, I drive a 2004 Volvo S60 T5. I'm trying to decide whether I want to purchase one of the new Mercedes-Benz C-class vehicles to replace it. The new engine/transmission combo for the 2006 C-class line is making me give it serious consideration. I'm trying to find out if there's enough benefit to make the move. I'd welcome all opinions!  The tough part is that the Volvo S60 T5 is perfectly fine. For some quick comparisons (the first number is the Volvo figure, the second is the 2006 MB C280):  Cylinders: 5 vs. 6 HP: 208 vs. 228 (2.5L vs. 3.0L) Torque: 236 ft lbs 1500 RPM vs. 221 ft lbs 2700 RPM (the Volvo is turbocharged...)  I like the Volvo's ride, power, and smoothness. What I don't like is that the S60 is not quite as compact. The turning radius for the S60 is 38.7"" (the C280 touts 35.3"" - which would be better for me in the area I live). The width of the S60 is 71.4"" vs. the C280's 68.0"".

There are two fallacies in this post. (1) That Lexus fanatics are *fuming*, and (2) that BMW fanatics don't seem to notice....1) Lexus fanatics are NOT fuming, rather we recognize the vast superiority of the IS350 over the 330i. The numbers speak for themselves, or do you want me to post them for ya ? The tester Bimmer couldn't even make it through the test mechanically.... breaking down under its own weight 2) And Bimmer fans are slowly but surely waking up to the new C&D review. Just wait until it is widely available on newstands. I don't think most BMW officianados ever imagined an entry level Lexus to do a 5.1s 0-60, and a 13.7s @ 104mph to the 1/4-mile ??? An e90 cannot even approach these numbers. And that is an auto tranny IS350 going against a 6MT 330i. Just imagine the IS with a 6MT ?????? And the difference b/w these two cars, according to C&D ? 1 pt separating 1st from 2nd !!!  That is a virtual tie. Maybe BMW needs to be more concerned that teir tester car proved to be unreliable when faced with its peers.WIll be interesting to see how BMW reacts to this new challenge from Lexus.

It might be the perfect combo for you.  I test drove an S40, and think I would've been happy with it, but it was too small.

(everything u can get in a $65K full-size lux sedan), and priced competitively (based on mag reports) against the e90 that C&D described as ""Platinum VISA priced"", and you have yourself a car to be worried about.Lexus is not worried they did not get it right, just wait until the car hits showrooms before we pronounce hit-or-miss.... Did you read the C&D review yet ? Here is a quote: ""Welcome to the most exuberant Lexus ever built"" I suggest you take the time to digest the review and you'll see that the 330i did NOT win the comparo on objective stats....You gotta ask how the 330i won by 1 pt ? Did you see the numerous mechanical issues that the tester had ? I can understand why you don't want to face that fact and instead claim ""HP is not everything"", as if the IS is only about HP (see above). Like C&D said, HP is just one thing, ""... Lexus has also poured sweat into the steering and suspension..."" On your part, gentlemen, feel free to discount the new IS, I am sure BMW execs are not, and true entry lux sport sedan buyers are going to seriously want to jump into a Lexus sedan that can do the amazing things this IS350 can do as tested, knowing they are looking at a car that is well-built, very fast, very safe, and very reliable, with excellent customer service to boot...."

Let's see, of the 3 major cateogries - vehicle, powertrain and chassis, the IS350 beat out the 330i in 2 of 3 (vehicle and powertrain), but lost in the chassis category. Hmmm ! The IS350 is a better car where it matters, vehicle (fit-and-finish, ergonomics, style, etc) and powertrain (performance, engine flexibility, tranny, etc). Gotta-have-it-factor: dead tie.

And if you die-hard fanatics cannot even see that these two cars are a virtual tie, you must have more denial than I think...But more to your point: We all know how much these auto rags rave about the 3-series as the benchmark of BMW automotive engineering excellence. To beat that car will take a herculian task. And the IS350 did, even with a slushbox ! The measured (objective and subjective) difference b/w the e90 and the IS350 is infinitesimal, at best... virtual tie at worst.

But even though the magazine touted the G as being a ""BMW beater"", they confessed that the only reason the BMW lost was because it was priced higher than a comparably equipped G. The G has been selling for some time now- and guess what? BMW has survived, no wait- thrived. I equate the upcoming lexus with the introduction of the G. I'm not one who pulls out a magazine and points to numbers when justifying my decision, but kdshapiro makes a good point- Toyota, with all of their resources, were, despite their best effort and a truck load of HP, unable to bump BMW off its seat at the top. And some of you are not giving those of us in our early 20's enough credit- I choose the 3 over all the other models because I like a car that can hold it's own as a complete package.

Sit in 'em and drive'em... more than empirical numbers will shine through and you'll ""feel"" the difference.  True in many products from watches to suits!There are buyers for all of these cars that have differing reasons for their choices... some financial, some just want the fastest for the least and some want the finest that today's automotive engineers can produce regardless of the price - and none are necessarily wrong.

Well… maybe because it is useless to defend something that you simply love and enjoy driving? I don’t see any point in it. But to answer your statement about bmw handling (“same ol' same ol' … how BMW is such a great handling car… blah blah blah..”) I guess I just remembered how I measured the handling once. I was driving my friend’s Lexus (nice comfortable car) and turned steering wheel slightly and anticipated (actually needed) that the car will start turning. I turned the steering wheel a good, I’d say, 10 maybe 13 degrees. Well, needless to say, the car kept going straight. At the same speed and turning bmw’s steering wheel the same number of degrees, bmw actually responds. That is why I personally prefer bmw because of its handling  and other things. But in no way I am saying that my car is better or, God forbids, beats yours!

So continue your head-in-the-sand folly.In 1990 the LS400 undercut the price of the nearest BMW/MBs by over 10k.  They got in on price and ability.  The LS400 was more reliable and almost as nice as the BMW/MB counterparts.  But it had a massive ace up its sleeve...the price was so scary  low (35k!) that people had to look.  This is the tactic Infiniti took with the G35.  Offer 90%- 95% of the 3 series but at 5-7k lower.  It's worked and the G35 has carved out a niche.Will Lexus do this with the IS250/350?  Indications are the IS250 will start at 30k.  Stripped.  No leather, no xenons, no moonroof.  IS350 would probably be 34-36k (we'll know soon).  As far as I can tell, to get xenon lights on the IS350 you must get the 3rd highest package and a moonroof is still an option.  We know the cars will come with this stuff on lots so it's safe to say an IS350's gonna run over 38k msrp.  I'm betting (given GS pricing differences between the 6 and 8) that the IS350 will start at 36-37k (just like the 330i).  So I'm not expecting the IS350 to be less than a 330i.Where's the value? The value proposition is what got Lexus where it is.  Never forget that.  Just like Hyundai, Lexus came up offering almost as much as the competition but for less money."

I was staying in a hotel in Germany in 1993 at which a meeting of MB executives was taking place. I was driving an LS400 at the time - a wonderful car.

With gas prices estimated to be going to $4/gallon, Toyota has picked a lousy time introduce what is probably a gas sucking sports sedan. Unless you don't drive as intended, this thing will suck gas. You cannot have blazing acceleration and blazing gas mileage simultaneously.3. There seems to ""concerns"" with the bias of the C&D toward BMW, seemingly having a ""lesser"" car take the #1 spot.4. There is no doubt the engine is bigger on the IS, but that doesn't make it a better sports sedan.5. BMW is not *dead*.6. It's going to take a fair number of reviews to see where the IS350 fits in the pecking order. When the G35, it was the ""king was dead"". Not even close for BMW. It beat BMW in every metric. As more comparos were done different results began to emerge.7. The 5.1 to 60 is impressive no doubt. I wouldn't want to try that with my car though.8.

They also state that they felt the car had lost some of the edge of the IS300.  Basically they are saying it's less of a drivers car than it needs to be to compete with the 3 series on those terms.This all comes on the heels of a rather solid review of the E90.  They had their nits to pick with it as well, but said its chassis makes up for a lot.  Sounds like it's a very sharp-handling car.  Can't wait to drive one.

Overall, I'd say the test was rigged, cos a broken down car should score ZERO, and using previous yr's number shows how much they wanted the Bimmer to win.... So much for objectivity !For those happy that I have left, dream on... Taking nothing away from the 3-er, it simply is not the ultimate driving machine. That is all hype !  For those who won't give the IS350 a test, you will be missing a great car. I'll surely wave bye to you as you watch my tail disappear in traffic in my IS350."

I've been driving an automatic car for a week now.  I'm bored to death.  There's barely any engine control - even with dorky shift buttons or paddles.  My interest in my drive time has gone from paying total attention to passively sitting in long lines even when the lane beside me is moving.  Why bother pulling out? I'll have to endure the excrutiatingly slow shifts and harsh downshifting one gets from automatics.  Honestly, my drive with an automatic has turned me into another listless worker bee either heading to the hive or away from it.

Since I now know that I'm not a driver (just a passenger) I decided to read the Wall St. Journal on the way to work, rather than pay attention to the road, steer, brake, accelerate or play with my TLs autostick.  Well, after getting the car going in the right direction (weird, I was in the driver's seat and it seemed if I didn't use the steering wheel, accelerator and gear selector, the car wouldn't move!) I whipped out the WSJ and began reading.  As my TL approached the 90 degree left turn on my street, the TL didn't turn!!!  It went straight into my neighbor's yard!  As if there was no driver!  Funny, though.  Every other morning, when I'm ""not driving"" the TL responds to my decisions and inputs using all the controls provided to ""drive"" the car.  I'm so confused, could it be that manual or automatic or semi-automatic or some variation, we really are all drivers?   :confuse: Actually, I do understand what you ""Live Manual or Die"" guys are talking about.  I'm just having some Internet fun...  Well, I think it's fun...     For the first 15 years of my driving life, I was a die-hard 5 speed manual guy (Saab 99, VW Scirocco, Mitsubishi Mirage Turbo, Acura Integra).  And then came the fateful day I was promoted into sales and inherited the Sales Manger's Olds (at 11,000 miles the gas tank ruptured a seam on the TOP of the tank!) and for the next 5 years, boring but servicable domestic, automatic  sedans.  I did however, teach the evil wife to drive a stick and bought her a Nissan Sentra SE - R (fun, fun, fun) followed by a Saab 900s (fun, very practical.  My attempt to avoid an SUV or Minivan) as the family began to grow.  These were mine to play with on the weekend.   I ""retired"" (downsized    ) from the sales game and bought my company Dodge Intrepid (nice car but very loud and not Honda build quality.  But reliable and good looking, good in snow).  I believed I would return to the land of the ""driver"" soon.Once I began my second career, it was time for a new car.  As I was now a commuter, evil wife suggested I drive the Saab for a month of commuting to ensure I wanted a stick.  I was sure the commute wouldn't sway me away, I was wrong.  It was just no fun shifting between  1-2-3 every 17 seconds, rarely getting above 40mph.  After a week, I returned the Saab, bought a Chrysler 300M ( I can't believe I bought a first model year, domestic CHRYSLER!  I broke every rule there!) and had a plan.  The wife's next car would be a 5 speed (Saab 9-5 or maybe A4 Avant, possibly a BMW 3 wagon?  I was looking forward to shopping for her) and I would continue my tradition of enjoying row your own boat driving on the weekend.  Ah, but as is often the folly that is my grand planning, the wife said she was done with manuals, she commutes too and driving to her is just a necessary evil.  Hence, the Saab turned into (what else?) a Lexus RX 300 as our family grew again.  She's very happy, therefore I'm very happy.Will there be a manual tranny again in my future?  Who knows.  Until then, I will continue to drive whatever I choose, understanding those that rhapsodize about their fabulous fifth to third slingshot passes on I95 or deftly selecting just the right gear for a sweeper on their favorite hometown back roads.

Warranty (another reason not to buy ""rust proofing"" from the dealer!).I think C and D has a history of forgiving (overlooking) build and reliability flaws for cars that they love to drive.  As its recent 50 year anniversary issue has pointed out, the mag basically started as an ode to British sports cars back in the '50s.  And, as history has shown, we all know how reliable and well built British cars were!  But they loved the driving experience, and that was the thrust of the relationship.  C and D noted the imperfections, and because of their respect for the marque, downplayed it as far as rating the new 3.  IMHO, of course.  What a cool comparo, there's a car there for everyone!Another thought:  BMW has been building BMWs for a long time.  Acura, Lexus and Infiniti have been building ""BMWs"" for, what, five years?

The setup's not as engaging as my e46 perf pack. 3. If i have to put up with how unreliable BMWs are, then I want the car to be ludicrously fun. An e90 is not ludicrously fun.

The e90 M3 sedan, assuming it comes out, should satisfy me to a level of 91-92%.  The 335i allows me to avoid having something as garish as an M on my car and no ostentatious gills on the fenders.  Plus the 335i would address something i hate about the current 3 series line up - no torque.  I have stated several times I prefer VW's 2.0T to my e46's inline 6.  I like the full blast of torque from 1800-5000 rpm.  Having over 300 ft-lbs of torque over a broad range of the powerband in an e90 would suddenly take the decent car to a higher level - nice handling (ideally tightened up more for the 335i), matched to power for once.  The G35  is faster than an e46 and e90.  So what, the car's got snap oversteer issues.  I want the whole package.  sublime handling, crazy power and 4 doors.  As for price, BMW bumped the price of the 325i to 330i about 4-5k.  I'd hope the same bump would occur to the 335i and then the M3 would ring in at 50-55k starting.

If I had to pay 5.5k in repairs I can guarantee you I would be owning a Japanese performance-luxury sedan.So after 7 years why do I still own my Bimmer--because currently my car's maintenance costs can out-Lexus any Lexus.If I am going to enjoy any performance car(though I am pushing the definition of performance by calling my 168hp 99 BMW323 a performance car) then it would have to be reliable!To each their own!!"
4223,"September 11, 2005  3:40AM",fedlawman,"""though I am pushing the definition of performance by calling my 168hp 99 BMW323 a performance car.""I think your definition of performance is spot-on. You may not have M3 horsepower, but you also don't carry the extra 300 lbs., and you don't feel the road through wheels/tires that are almost a foot wide and weigh 50 lbs/corner! Anyone can drive a 300+ hp car quickly, but it takes real skill to go fast with only half the horses (and it's more fun).I'll take light weight and a responsive chasis over HP any day - that's my definition of performance."
4224,"September 11, 2005  7:12AM",frisconick,"I agree that hp is not everything, but I really like the M3 and M5.  However, with respect to BMWs, I am concerned about reliability. But I must add CR does recommend the 3 series BMW because of recent good reliability ratings."
4225,"September 11, 2005  2:15PM",dewey,I'll take light weight and a responsive chasis over HP any day - that's my definition of performance.I agree! HP in itself does not make performance.
4226,"September 11, 2005  4:32PM",blueguydotcom,"Agreed.  HP is not everything.  The G35, 330c hemi and the IS350 have tons of hp.  Two out of three don't impress me and that's only because I haven't driven the lexus. I just can't see spending 40k on a 330i e90 - great handling, nice ride, perfect interior, but lacking in verve.  It's easy to improve handling with simple mods (wheels, sways, springs, etc) but really getting extreme hp comes from the factory or it requires some warranty crushing mods (like the folks who turbo their e46 330is).  Going fast in corners driving a slow car is fun.Going faster in corners driving a really faster car is way more fun."

4230,"September 12, 2005 12:01AM",blueguydotcom,"You bought a car with 250+ hp, right (TL)?  So please don't babble about how one doesn't need power.  We all want it.  You did too, or you would have bought a cylinder camry - better gas mileage, more room, etc. These are luxury performance sedans.  Performance is in the title.The 65 mph speed limit thing is a weak argument position regarding hp. HP has little to do with top speed or acceleration.  A car with 135 hp can break the limit without breaking a sweat.  There's nothing illegal about strongly accelerating away from the on-ramp stoplights or accelerating out of a corner strongly. Also many people track their cars..Remember this forum is about cars that luxury items.  Toys!  These are not necessary vehicles.  They're toys."

I suppose their answer is that they could go fast if they wanted to. How many have lots of HP and handling and live way out in rural areas where they can truly put handling and HP to use.  Probably not too many.  I see many folks in Corvettes, BMWs driving very sedately on Interstates when I pass them in one of my vehicles (minvan). Many are driving about the same pace as golden seniors in their full-size Fords and Mercurys. They don't want to be noticed by police I guess.  Maybe a large point of it all is ""to be seen in it"" and the perceived prestige.

However, according to consumerreports.org, the 330 (225hp) mileage doesn't look all that impressive for overall driving. It's less (efficient) than the '04 TL (270hp), and equal the '03 TL-S (260hp).  :confuse:     I guess to get that kind of (claimed) mileage one better start taking a vacant freeway/interstate (which, sometimes, translates to a longer route) to work.

The fact that the brakes failed doesn;t enter into their mind.  I know a few people who owned Alfa Romeos in the '60s, 70's, & 80's.

P.S.: On the street, the 540 was nice and roomy, but the only word that comes to mind when describing the interior is ""sterile"". I'll take an M35 or 45 any day.

I also feel that the E90 does not have as attractive a view from the driver's seat as the E46, with its more cockpit-like feel. The E90's interior is less unique, more generic, less ""traditional BMW"". It seems more similar to what you might find in an Audi (not that that's bad -- just not distinctively BMW). Even the C&D review mentioned something about not caring for dash design."
4317,"September 28, 2005  3:48PM",dewey,"True, the e46 cockpit- feel is missing in the e90 and that is a shame!

4320,"September 28, 2005 10:53PM",blueguydotcom,I keep mentioning Hyundai pulling off what Toyota's done in the past 16 years.  So far people scoff.  So did BMW/MB in the 80s.  They're not laughing at Lexus now.15 years from now will Hyundai be the new Lexus?  I wouldn't count them out.  They've gone from 1980s joke (much like Toyota was a joke in the 60s) to strong value contender in the 00s (much like Toyota in the 80s).  It's not beyond the realm of possibility for the 2020 Hyundai AL760 Entry Luxury Sport Sedan with 1500 hp to be the big contender aiming to knock off Infiniti and Lexus' aging but still popular platforms.

4325,"October  6, 2005 12:47AM",shanky,"I am in Sacramento/CA, and have ordered a MB c350 (obsidian black/stone) with all options excluding all-leather and 4Matic, for invoice price+750 (costco deal). I am a first time luxury-car buyer, and had test drove BMW 325, Lexus ES330 and Avalon Ltd (all 2006) within a span of 2 days.  The MB test drive was fantastic - smooth ride, effortless and quiet acceleration, very responsive steering, rich interior (interior/exterior looks are much better than the 2006 BMW 3 series). I had test driven the BMW 325 in tight corners at about 40-50 mph (as I did with the MB), and did not notice any ""significant/superior handling"" that the beemer-fans rave about. I tested the BMW just hours before the MB, and soon as I got into the MB I could see the superior appointments - the different can be instantly felt. It was love at first sight! The BMW had very bland interior, and a straight black front panelling that I disliked (old Corolla look). Plus, I found the driver seats a bit tight for my comfort. Both BMW and MB have horrible cup-holders - the rear ones are too shallow for comfort.  On a price comparison, loading the comparable BMW 330 with the same options as the c350 gave me a price higher by about $400 for the 330. So the beemer did not have price advantage over the MB (except when you factor the free-maintainence for 4 years offered by BMW versus the $300/year needed for the MB).  The Lexus ES 330 was cool, but a bit elephantine for my needs. Same with the Avalon, which I found smoother/quiter than the Lexus. Good thing about the Avalon was the new engine (260 hp plus) and the flat flooring in the rear seat (very cool for the center seat). Also, the Lexus/Avalon looks very Camry-ish to me, and I wanted to stand out from the crowd (heh! heh!)  I did not notice significant difference between the C and S modes (Comfort/Sport) in the feel of the car, except during startup, when it starts in 2nd gear in C mode for a smooth start.  I love the 21/29 mpg rating since most of my driving is on freeways to work.  I will opt for Michelin tires though (instead of the standard all-weather Continental). I also plan on getting the wheels chromed. MB's look best when they shine!"

Drive a 330i with sport and you'll understand.  Then again, you drove an Avalon so odds are good sporty driving isn't yoru thing."
4329,"October  6, 2005  5:43AM",shanky,"yes, you are correct..I was not looking for a pure sporty car - I wanted a good mix of luxury and sportiness. My top speed is not going to be above 100mph, and nor am I going to be whizzing around corners !. Moreover feedback from the road was desired to be minimal - but not so much as to dull the senses   I was also impressed by the excellent reviews for the new MB engine upgrade and its smooth 7-tranny.I did not want the AWD models (saving on mpg!) and did not test drive the BMW 330i (nor the c350 sport, nor the MB 4MATIC options). I got disinterested mostly (pardon me pls if anyone is offended !) by the interior of the 325, and hence did not try out the 330."

I also think BMWs are some beautiful cars (crazy about the new 3) and the 3 is a blast to drive. :P I just recently attended a driving event where I drove the MB E350 and C350 and the BMW 325i on a closed course. Both MBs handle quite well. But, imo, neither MB came close to matching the road grip, turn handling and general ""tossability"" and pure driving fun of the 325i. I've also driven the 330i Sport pkg on a closed course recently and with its extra power it's just that much more fun.I absolutely love the tight, ""right on"" steering of the 3s.

If so, I am really conflicted because I'm trying to stay as cool as possible within my two ideal color combinations for an 06 6MT....  Now that I have waited 3 years to get my TL (when they finally offer WDP w/ Ebony for 2006 - got to love it    ), people are telling me that this may, in fact, be the ""warmer"" combination in the summer (So Cal) than my second favorite (Anthracite w/ Quartz). Please tell me it isn't so.....  Any opinions from any of you that have had previous cars w/ these general color combos?  Is a dark exterior/light interior a cooler temperature combo than light exterior/dark interior?

4354,"October 13, 2005  3:44AM",jiminthehills,"Thanks, guys for the input.I posed this heat question to some of the engineers at work and one of them told me to take two thermometers to the Acura dealership at 2pm and quickly throw them into the two candidate's passenger seats and let them bake in the closed cars for 20 minutes. Then, open the driver's door of each car and observe the readings as they come down over the next 5-10 minutes. This may be more telling than what I could tell from a subjective ""seat-of-the-pants"" test.  Not bad advice - I actually may do it!  My concern now (after all this research) is that even after using the techniques to cool the car prior to entering, the Ebony leather will retain heat longer than the Quartz (grey), especially being trapped against my back side while the car is trying to cool on a hot summer day....  Even though the Ebony is beautiful, the day in and day out hassle of the extra heat may drive me nuts after awhile, and the beauty may turn out to really be only skin deep...:).

4356,"October 13, 2005  6:14AM",tturedraider,"I have a suggestion that might give you the best of both worlds.Tint your windows. I HIGHLY recommend Llumar brand. I have used Llumar for over 20 years and it is excellent. I have never had any problems with hazing or bubbling. Their top tier tint comes with a lifetime warranty.Choose the top of the line Llumar product and I'm sure you will be pleased. Be sure to choose a ""metalized"" tint. They have tints now that block virtually all UV rays and have high degrees of heat rejection. You don't even have to get a really dark tint to do the job.I always use about the second lightest tint and have very good results.I am a big believer in white cars. I live in the Great state of Texas and you know we have tons of HOT sun! I don't have empirical evidence, but in my experience I have found that even light colored cars absorb significantly more heat than white cars do. Plus, I admit I really like the brightness and cleanness of white. Even though it seems counterintuitive, white actually hides dirt better than any other color.High quality tinting also protects and preserves your interior.If you have tinting on your windows and use a reflective sunshade  :shades: in your windshield, I'll bet the black interior won't be too bad.  btw - leather adjusts temperature much faster and better than vinyl.my .02, fwiwalso, btw - don't get the tint done by your dealer. They'll charge you at least twice as much. Find a good Llumar dealer and let them do the installation. That's what your dealer would do and then double the price to you."

4385,"October 20, 2005  8:42PM",blueguydotcom,"Here's a good breakdown on how the DSG works:http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/jk/031119.htmInside the computer controlled gearbox there are four shafts: two input shafts and two output shafts. The input shafts are concentric, with one shaft passing through the centre of the other hollow input shaft. There are two multi-plate clutch packs similar to those found in automatic transmissions. Each clutch pack connects one of the input shafts to the engine, so depending upon which is applied, either one of the two input shafts can transfer power. An oil pump at the rear of the gearbox supplies hydraulic pressure for the clutches.The speed gears are divided between the two output shafts. First, third, fifth and reverse gear are on one output shaft while second, fourth and sixth gears are on the other shaft. Synchronisers are moved by the computer to lock each of the speed gears to their output shaft as required. Each output shaft has a pinion gear that drives the differential.When the driver places the shift lever in drive, First gear is engaged inside the transmission, but the clutch doesn't engage until the driver steps on the gas. Because the clutch is running in oil, it can slip without burning up, allowing the car to creep along in first gear just as an automatic would. Step harder on the gas and the clutch is fully applied. A neat feature of the control system allows the driver to step on the gas and brake at the same time. Audi calls it Launch Control and it allows F1-type starts. In Sport mode with both pedals pressed, the engine revs to 3200 rpm. Release the brake and the car launches in drag strip fashion.With the transmission engaged in first gear, the computer locks second gear to the other output shaft, but the input shaft clutch for that gear is not engaged. When it is time to shift, the computer releases the clutch for the first gear input and engages the clutch for the second gear input. In preparation for the next shift, the computer now shifts from first to third gear but leaves its clutch disengaged until the shift is requested. As the car's speed increases, the computer continues to pre-select the next gear so all it has to do is switch clutches. There is no grinding, no delays, and no shock.By monitoring driving style, the computer predicts whether the driver will request an upshift or downshift next so it can pre-select the correct gear. It is possible to fool the computer by driving erratically, but even if the wrong gear is pre-selected it only takes a fraction of a second for it to catch up. This transmission shifts fast, with shift times in the .03 to .04 second range. Even an excellent driver has trouble matching that consistently, and this transmission can do it all day long."

4395,"October 21, 2005  2:13PM",designman,"Perhaps there is problem with the general perception of transmission genre. The term &#147;Sequential Manual&#148; is somewhat of a misnomer, only half accurate hence misleading. Both GEAR SELECTION and TORQUE CONVERSION can be automated. The major difference between the true manual transmission and all others&#151;conventional Automatic, Sequential Gearbox and CVT&#151;is that with the true manual transmission, the human being is not only the shifter, HE IS ALSO THE TORQUE CONVERTER BY WAY OF THE CLUTCH PEDAL. He is an integral part of the transmission mechanism. It is the only type of transmission where torque conversion is not achieved automatically. Perhaps another problem with perception is the term &#147;torque converter&#148;. Although it is a specific part in the automatic transmission, torque conversion happens in all types of transmissions, but is not commonly associated with any type of transmission except the &#147;Automatic&#148;. Now to further convolute this mess, we must realize that the transmission itself&#151;any transmission&#151;is a torque converter. The part known as the &#147;torque converter&#148; is a transmission within a transmission. It may sound confusing but this may be because there are snags in the naming conventions to begin with.

Both Audi and BMW include all service in their warranties whereas Infiniti does not.

I instantly ruled out another 5 series because I hate Bangle's ""styling"". I have tested the STS, RL, CTS, E350, A6, GS and M. Guess what: NONE of them is BETTER than my old 528. NONE of them. Yes, they have some new technology bits, but as far as ride, performance, quietness, solid construction, reliability, handling, gas mileage, roominess, whatever, they all have significant shortfalls. Yes, some are better in one area or the other, but overall, none have the full set of attributes that my older car does in my opinion. One thing is very clear: BMW builds the very best road cars on the planet. No one else is close for second place. Some may accelerate better, have fancier interiors, whatever, but BMW owns the road.  Because or Mr. Bangle's styling, I may not replace my 97 E39 with another BMW, but then, I may just keep what I have.

4426,"October 29, 2005  4:09PM",blue01s4,"Yes, I believe BMW is their target, but I am not convinced Lexus understands what a BMW is.I can not agree with this statement more.Mistakes IMO Lexus has made with regard to their pursuit of BMW with regard to ""Sportiness/Performance"":-AWD is a great sporting application.  It offers great traction in all weather conditions.  However, AWD systems cause high amounts of drive line power loss .  Why would you only combine an AWD system with your lower horsepower engine?  This is not consistent with a goal of producing a sporty/performance vehicle.  (BTW, they did the same thing with the new GS)-Manual transmissions have always been associated with sporting/performance applications.  Again, why would you only offer a MT with your lower hp engine? Again, this is not consistent with a goal of producing a sporty/performance vehicle.-At least I have to commend them on making the vehicle RWD.  Acura is still trying to make sporty FWD vehicles to compare with BMW (though they do a fairly decent job of it!).(Now for my bias) You rarely see a Japanese made vehicle out-perform a comparable German made vehicle in any comparison (Infiniti seems to be the rare exception to the rule)."
4427,"October 29, 2005  5:47PM",brightness04,"(Now for my bias) You rarely see a Japanese made vehicle out-perform a comparable German made vehicle in any comparison You said it: it's a very biased statement.  The whole statement hinges on your defnition of ""out-perform"" and ""comparable.""  There are plenty Japanese cars that out accelearate and out-handle German cars in the same size segment.  Ultimately, choosing a car is a balancing act among four things: size, sportiness (accelearation and handling) and luxury content, all three balanced against cost.  German car makers historically have endeared itself to car rags by cheating on three out of four categories: fielding a car that was substantially smaller than compeition (3 vs. TL, G, ES, etc.),  with less luxury content and interior, plus at higher cost.  Three out of four compromises made, any wonder it would win in the fourth category?  Scientificly, there are two ways of defining what's comaprable: either by size or by cost.  The Germans loses almost every time if either objective measures is held constant for comparison: TL and G beats 5, E and A6 on handling quite easily if size is the criterium for ""comparable.""   TL and G beat 325, C230 and A4 1.8/2.0 handily if price is the criterium for ""comparable."".   It is only when one relaxes standards and bias the ""comparable"" in favor of the Germans that they would win compros; any wonder in the rigged result?  If you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury, chances are indeed good that you will get better handling unless the mfr is utterly incompetent."
4428,"October 29, 2005  7:38PM",fedlawman,"If you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury, chances are indeed good that you will get better handlingAs long as the size of the car is big enough for the target market, it doesn't matter that the E90 is smaller than the IS, they're both big enough. Personally, I think the G35 is too big - more of a mid-size car pretending (very well, mind you) to be compact.Luxury is more than just feature content. Luxury, in large part, is qualified by the ""feel"" of an automobile. How refined is the drivetrain? How quiet is the interior? How solid is the body structure? How well does the suspension absorb impacts and/or transmit them to the cockpit? How do the doors feel/sound when you shut them? What do the plastics look/feel like? How smoothly do the controls operate? An E90 with vinyl seats and halogen headlights may be lacking some features one expects to have in an ""entry-level luxury"" car, but it is definitely a luxurious where it really matters.It really boils down to individual priorities. Size, amenities, handling, acceleration, refinement. All of these cars offer a different mix of them."
4429,"October 29, 2005  9:20PM",blue01s4,"Here's the thing though, the Japanese mfrs are theoretically just as competent to make a great performing small or medium sized sedan as the Germans are.  So why do they not make direct competition for the Germans.  As you said, the 3 series is quite a bit smaller than the TL, G, ES (I can't believe you even mentioned the ES - what car has that thing ever out performed?).  So, why not compete directly with them?  The TSX is similar in size to the 3 series, but Acura gives it a relatively weak engine, makes it FWD and what do you expect, it doesn't compete.  With regard to the TL and G which 5, E or A6 will they beat with regards to performance?  That's another (IMO) problem with Japanese mfrs - they give you limited choices.  You can get an A6 3.2, A6 4.2, S6 (soon) or RS6 (in a few years), and similar options exist with BMW and MB.  Will the TL out perform all of them?  Obviously not.  You don't have to be that biased (or at all) to see that in regards to handling/performance (and I don't just mean straight line) German cars generally out perform comparable Japanese cars - IMHO of course   )  Don't take this as a personal assault.

What you call ""options"" are really the elimination of the very practical option of being able to get the A4 or A6 at an otherwise lower price, and the even more critically important option of getting an A4 or A6 that is reliable.  The plethra of non-standardization is the big reason behind German unreliability and high cost. I can't believe you even mentioned the ES - what car has that thing ever out performed? .

Yup, $7,000 (as close to apples to apples as possible) for a car that will flat embarras a 93 Aero in any performance category.Then again there is the G35.  A price difference of $7,000 there?  Nope, more like $1,000 (as close to apples to apples as possible).  Of course while the G35 apparently cannot get around a race track as fast as the 330i can, it can still handily destroy the aforementioned 93 Aero in that same environment.The Saab is a competent car (I drove one last week), but it ain't no performance oriented RWD sedan, and it doesn't drive like one either.Me, I'll spend that $7,000 and figure that the three years of smiles on my face was well worth not going to Aruba for three weeks.  ;-)Best Regards,Shipo"

4476,"November  2, 2005  3:21PM",tayl0rd,"It looks like you're more interested in sport and speed based on your selections.  The 550i is definitely the most expensive of the bunch once you pile on the options (even before you add any options).  The most sporting of the bunch will be the M3 and CTS-V.  It would probably be a toss-up between the C55 and 550i (non-sport) on which is the least sporting.  The 550i is decidedly larger than the others.  The C55 can't be had with a manual, all the others can (the CTS-V is manual only).If you want a fast highway cruiser for you and guests that won't beat you up on the rough roads, but won't let you down when the road gets twisty, 550i all the way.If you want hard-core performance all the time and want to be able to get the kids ""scared straight"" in the twisties, CTS-V will do nicely.If you want all out balls-to-the-wall performance for you and a mate, and you don't mind your body taking a little beating on the city streets, the M3 will work.If you want to blaze down the freeway as hard as you can and don't mind slowing down a bit for the occasional bend in the road, the C55 will suit.By process of elimination, the M3 is the only coupe in the bunch so out with that.  The 550i is much bigger than the others so out it goes.  By mentioning the M3, you showed that you are more on the sport side of the spectrum, and mentioning the 550i showed that you probably have passengers to haul from time to time.  Both of those eliminate the C55 and that just leaves the CTS-V.Get the CTS-V!"

4478,"November  2, 2005  6:34PM",lovemyclk,And this means what on the road race course?
4479,"November  2, 2005  8:10PM",lovemyclk,"The ""readiness to swap the front and back ends"" is called oversteer, not skittishness.  To me, skittishness is from uncontrolled body motions due to a less than ideal suspension setup.  Controlled oversteer is, indeed, fun on the road course.  Skittishness is not    A 911 and it's rear engine layout has nothing in common with these cars from a handling persperctive.  Most of the severe oversteer tendencies of the 911 went away several platform generations ago anyway.Granted, a lesser skilled driver in a 997 today could drive around a road course more easily today than he/she could in a pre-993 911.  Today's RWD cars - at least the ones we are discussing in this forum - are all competent... some moreso than others.  The 3-Series BMW offers the finest driving experience in its class, IMO.  That is not to say the IS and G are incompetent - far from it.  The little things add up over the course of a road race, and I believe the 330 shines when taking this into account.  The day-to-day driving experience evens the field to a certain degree, and that is the world that contributes to the perspective taken by many drivers of these autos.  Some just like knowing they have a superior driving machine, some prefer creature comforts, some are driven by their own sense of styling, etc... there is something for everyone in this class."

One interesting comment was that they thought the IS350's interior was ""cold and Teutonic"", where the 330i's was more ""warm and inviting"". So how's that for a turnabout? Lexus over-Germanized their car? :P They also gave the BMW extra points for features like rain-sensing wipers, adaptive headlights and taillights, etc.Of course, a car comparison test that takes up just a few inches of newspaper column space is not very comprehensive, but I thought that their evaluation adds fuel to the fire."

The TL vibrations and rattles that are mentioned on these boards are unsettling. I'd take that into consideration. The TL is less of a racecar, and a bit more packed with features.  It is a close call, though.  I think the TL is a better all-around commuting vehicle.  If I was driving mostly on windy country roads, the G35 might be more appealing."

This is a legitimate problem.  My  dashboard has not faded.  The leather has stretched a little, but it does not look bad.Lastly, if you get the non-navi TL (comes with the horrendous Bridgestone El-42s), you WILL want to get snow tires.

4522,"November 18, 2005  7:23PM",laurasdada,"Hi, Al:  Boston area resident here, TL owner.  I second what most of the posts after yours have pointed out.  I chose the TL over the G35x also, because in favor of the TL:Superior interior/exterior style and interior materials.Smoother/quieter ride.Not having the added complexity/weight of AWD to carry around 365 days/yr.Better mpg.And, I suppose, a few $$$ less expensive, although that was not a major factor as I was shopping a broad price range.  But a factor...After almost 11 months, no vibrations.  One rattle, but only when the sunroof is in the ""vent"" position (which the dealer said they fixed at A1 service; they did not).  Leather looks fine, not brand new, but fine.  Dash does seem to have a bit of the discoloration issue, but cleaning it helps.The tires?  Now that's my biggest complaint.  They are terrible in the snow.  And I believe they flat spot.  I survived last winter, but it was a challenge.  I've always driven FWD into Maine, New Hampster & Vermont to ski and in 25 years I probably would have apprecitated AWD a few times, very few times.  For me, AWD is a nicety, not a necessity.  TL with the Bridgestone's is the first FWD I don't feel totally snow-confident in.  And it's not the car, it's the tires.So, overall, diggin' the TL!  Either is a fine choice.  TL is more luxury/sport, G is sport/luxury.  TL will probably be less expensive to operate overall, imho.  Good luck, keep us posted."

I dont think anyone will question that the tl has the much better interior, but i felt the g was good enuff and underneath it all, was the better car.No offense but the tl is a super accord, both good and bad. It just felt too close to the camry type cars i was trying 2 get out of. Dont get me wrong, if the tl had awd i would have snatched it up in a second, but the g just felt better on the road. I test drove each one over 4 times so i had a good feel for each car, and there are times when i sometimes think i should have gone with the tl, esp when im stuck in traffic and the nicer interior with more gadgets would have been nice. But as soon as i start moving in the g, i know i made the right choice. BTW for me the tl was more expensive to lease, even though it stickers much less than a fully loaded g35x.

Not surprisingly the winter tire equipped AWD cars fared the best in all but braking and some of the handling scenarios, however, much of their focus was comparing all-season AWD cars against their 2WD winter tire equipped siblings.  Hmmm, seems fairly germane to this latest thread.Funny thing though, contrary to some recent protestations, the only category that the all-season AWD cars won was acceleration.  The winter tire equipped E320 won every other category, some of them quite handily I might add.  The fact is that a winter tire equipped RWD sedan with a near 50-50 weight balance will easily out drive an otherwise identical all-season equipped AWD car.  Like it or don't, I'm only the messenger in this case.As far as some of the comments regarding how bad a winter tire shod car will drive on dry roads, well, I'm thinking that given the quality of some of the high performance winter tires that have been available for several years now, that that statement is a bit disingenuous.

I live near Detroit, where we have to deal with snow, but it's rare to have major snow of more than a few inches to get through.In similar conditions, the A4 was definitely much better and secure feeling in getting through the snow than the BMW, but so far the BMW has been sufficient and I have not felt the need for snow tires. The A4 was more ""fun"" in the snow since I could really accelerate and let the Quattro sort out the traction; on the BMW the same action causes the DSC to kick in and I continue forward, but slowly. And I think in a really tough situation, the A4 would be more likely to get me out of it.This spring, I intend to get a new wheel & tire package for the 325i, going to 17x8 wheels with 225/45 tires. But even though I'm probably going to stick with all-seasons for various reasons, I still plan on keeping my current 16-inchers around for winter mounting. Narrower tires (within reason) work better in the snow, and when the current tires get some more wear on them I'll replace them with a set of full winter tires."

Specific to this discussion I'm very troubled by folks who believe without question that an AWD sedan shod with OEM all season tires will outperform a similar (or all but identical) RWD sedan shod with high quality winter tires.  From the research that I've done and the driving in weather that I've experienced, the only area where the RWD car will be lacking is in acceleration in snow (or hill climbing, sort of the same thing), in every other way, the RWD/winter tire car should handily out perform the AWD/all-season car.In my case I live on a street with two sections that feature a climb with a grade of over 7.5%, and my driveway is about 9%.  Through it all my winter tire equipped 530i never had a single problem navigating either.  That being said, there are six houses on my street that sport driveways that the 530i was completely unable to climb in the snow.  Why?  Easy, they all have at least a 20% grade between the street and the house.  Were it that I lived in any of those six houses, you can absolutely bet that my wife and I would not only be driving cars with an AWD drive train, but they would both have a set of winter tires as well.

I just don't believe your statement that rwd outperforms awd only in acceleration""I need to split a few hairs here.  First off, let's assume like for like cars (i.e. G35 vs. G35x).  Secondly, is the AWD car equipped with All-Season tires (AS/AWD) or winter tires (WT/AWD)?  Third, is this hypothetical left turn made from a standing stop or are you rolling through the turn with little or no acceleration?If we are comparing AS/AWD to WT/RWD then I believe that the following would hold true:- From a standing stop (meaning that there is an acceleration component), the time to make the turn and clear the intersection is probably a wash with the edge going to the AS/AWD.- Rolling through the turn, WT/RWD should easily complete the turn safer and quicker than the AS/AWD.If we are comparing both cars shod with winter tires then I believe the following would hold true:- From a standing stop, the WT/AWD should handily beat the WT/RWD through the intersection.- Rolling through the turn, the WT/RWD should have a slight edge due to its lighter weight.""The icing on the cake of owning a car like the g35x is that it is rwd based unless the car detects that you need traction. Otherwise it drives like it's rwd counterpoint, the G35.""Errr, except for the extra weight that is.  There is another factor that may or may not be present in the two versions of the G35 (but is definitely a factor with the likes of the E60 and E90 BMWs).  Some manufacturers, BMW for instance, only offer a true Sport Package (stiffer/lower suspension and better rubber and wheels) on the RWD models.  While this situation is not really part of the AWD vs. RWD debate per-se, it is a very real world factor to be dealt with.  The standard suspension setup that comes on the AWD BMWs, while still competent, is no match for the ones that come on the RWD SP equipped models.  Rain, sleet, ice, snow or dry, the better handling suspension is still the better handling suspension.  To my way of thinking, an SP equipped RWD BMW will handle significantly better in the summer months versus the ""xi"" version, and during the winter months, assuming a high performance set of winter tires are used on the SP equipped ""i"", it should at least match (if not exceed) the capabilities of the ""xi"" except in hill climbing and acceleration.So, it seems that you've called my bluff and that wasn't my last word after all.  ;-)Best Regards,Shipo"

Edmunds, y'all got yer ears on?""Having all four wheels pulling and pushing you through the curves is going to be faster, than snow tires on a rwd only car.""Based upon various things that I've read, I'm thinking that that notion is something of an Urban Legend because it's been repeated so often.  The fact is that a tire has a certain limit of adhesion, and that by adding accelerative forces to a wheel that is doing the turning, you reduce that wheels' ability to turn, or the other way around.  Thinking back to the late 1980s I read a very interesting article about training road course drivers to push their cars to the very limit.  Back then the racing tires were capable of about one ""G"" of tractive forces (regardless of whether it was linear or lateral), and they had developed a cute accelerometer graphing device that would log the drivers' ability to keep the needle as close to the 1G mark throughout the entire course.  While theoretically possible to keep it pegged, even the best drivers were unable to keep it there all of the way around, however, there was a direct correlation between lap times and that magic 1G mark, the closer to the mark, the faster the time.Best Regards,Shipo"

Period.When driving on reduced traction surfaces, the ability to maintain control of your vehicle is primarily based on the inate ability of the tire to grip the surface (contact area, tread pattern, rubber compound, etc.), control input smoothness, and speed. Simply put, AWD helps, but it's not as important as having the proper tires and driving slowly and smoothly."

4584,"November 22, 2005  4:41AM",brightness04,"The point you are missing is that a reduced-friction surface is usually not an evenly smooth surface; there are patches with more friction than others.  Equally as important, when a vehicle is in a turn, the four wheels trace out different circles, hence different linear velocity.  The big advantage in an advanced AWD system is the ability to apportion torque to the wheel with the most grip.  It's not unlike LSD on RWD cars, except this time with LSD on all four wheels.  RWD with RSD beats RWD without it, all else being comparable; similarly, AWD cars win nearly all reduced friction races where they are allowed.  The disparity is so great as to make the competition between the two incomtemplable in racing circles."

The G35X, while certainly more sport biased than a 4-Runner, nevertheless makes some of the same SUV sacrifices in order to offer AWD traction. The decision to live with (purchase) those sacrifices is a personal one.Most reviewers that have driven both the g35 and the g35x say that there is about a .3 second difference in 0-60 times. These same reviewers, have also stated they cannot really tell the difference in handling between the two cars.To use your own words, Real world experience is probably more useful than magazine articles""Yes, I have driven both cars (back-to-back) and yes, I felt a definite difference in ride and handling. Your perception obviously differs.I don't see much difference in real world performance numbers between the rwd version and the awd version.The numbers may be close, but they FEEL and respond differently.The g35x has all of the advantages of awd when needed and the driving dynamics of a rwd sport sedan when the roads are dry.No, it has the driving dynamics of a 200 lb heavier rwd sport sedan when the roads are dry. Just because you can't tell the difference doesn't mean it isn't there."

But I get your point   I decided the slight differences between the two cars, driving the roads that I drive, means the g35x was the compelling choice. No, it has the driving dynamics of a 200 lb heavier rwd sport sedan when the roads are dry. Just because you can't tell the difference doesn't mean it isn't there. If you put the snow tires onto the rwd G 35, it will probably lose the slight handling advantages over the g35x with the All season rubber  As they say, YMMV."

I can't recall the review that I read before getting the G35x but they test drove both cars and felt the G35x performed better on the sport side due to the extra weight giving the driver more confidence going into and around turns. To me this makes sense and was coming from an unbiased source. Given your rating scale the reviewer would have given the G35x something lower than a 3, maybe a 2.5 or 2.6. Personally, after driving both I couldn't tell a difference when taking an on-ramp at the highest speed I was comfortable taking.Yes, I have driven both cars (back-to-back) and yes, I felt a definite difference in ride and handling. Your perception obviously differs. I suspect your findings were based on your perception heading into the test drives that the AWD couldn't perform as well given the extra weight and everything else you seem to know about cars. Real world driving and how the car feels when you drive it is the only test and opinion that matters when you're spending your own money. Too bad we couldn't have like a Coke/Pepsi blindfold test and see the results. I'm sure it would be a 50/50 split between the awd vs. rwd G35 ... but then again that's just my opinion  Scott"

Of course the date was yesterday's date and the REAL publication date was May of 1999.So, that said, it seems that my memory is a little faulty in that a RWD vs. AWD model shod like for like will show the AWD model being able to handle a little better than its RWD sibling.  That one exception aside, my basic premise of a winter tire equipped RWD sedan being more capable in the snow (except for acceleration/hill climb) versus its all-season equipped AWD stable mate seems to be well proven out in this article.Per Pat's suggestion of getting back on topic, I suggest that if we want to continue this discussion we should create a new topic, maybe ""AWD cars with All-Season tires vs. 2WD cars with winter tires"".

In braking, yes a clear advantage. The slalom test showed about a 1/2 mph advantage for the rwd winter tire shod Mercedes Vs. the all season shod awd copy.  Not really much difference there.  IF you factor in the fact that when the roads are not snow covered, your winter tire shod car will be a poor performer compared to the awd car with all season rubber, awd still offers some compelling advantages.    In Minnesota anyway, there are long stretches of time that the roads are clear.I hope everyone has a safe and fun Thanksgiving"

The sedans all probably have only five or so inches of clearence at suspension mounting points, and my car seems to have even less at the front chin.

I like the driving qualities, want a more upscale interior as well as some extra power and the AWD.  Not sold on the look of the new Passat, looking to go to a more premium brand.  Just started looking, drove the G35x today which had nice amenities but the 280hp is probably more power than I need at the expense of some things that for me should be a no-brainer at this price range (i.e., trip computer).  It also drives a little loud (the sales guy described it as the trademark Infiniti ""engine growl"").  My commute is beat-up city streets, so I'm looking for a soft ride (as opposed to an overly-tight sport suspension).  Haven't yet determined which of the ones on my ""list"" is the benchmark against which all others will be measured -- suffice it to say that, for me, the '03 Passat is a pretty good benchmark at this point.  Seems like many consider the BMW 3-series to be the benchmark, particularly for those like me who like the ""German-engineered"" driving experience (whatever that means).  I'm particularly interested in anybody's initial reactions to the new Lexus IS250 AWD -- there doesn't seem to be much out there on it yet.  Given that I haven't driven the Audi, Lexus, BMW, or Acura yet, I'm open to any input.Thanks in advance for your thoughts and feedback."
4622,"November 26, 2005  6:09AM",bplayer,"You may not get a soft ride for any of the cars on your list, except for the A4. Most of them are classified as luxury/sport, so the suspension may be too stiff for you. Make sure that you drive some of these bad road when you test drive.Another criteria to consider is space, especially in the back set. If you are not tall or typically very infrequently have average size people in the back then all these cars will be fine. If space is an issue, I think the IS250 will be the first drop out."

There are a multiple of reasons to choose one car over the other, but my process of elimination was:RWD bias of the awd package.G35x has a larger interior volume than the BMW 3 series.Have owned German autos prior, My 2000 Passat glx was a wonderful car, but needed a timing belt (around $1K), AM radio had stopped working (Again, $400 repair to keep stock antenna with existing radio)and finally, the interior at 75K miles was squeaking a lot.  Finally, my assumption that a Japanese automobile will be more reliable than its German competitors.So far I'm happy with the choice.  Don't know about the 200K miles, but I think the Infiniti has a better shot than most.  You have to drive the cars that fit your parameters, and pick which one fits your budget, and tickles your fancy the best.   There are a lot of cars for you to choose from have fun shopping!"

(duh, should've thought of that before I drove the G35x).   It's been snowing here in Cleveland over Thanksgiving, but not enough to really get a feel for the advantages of AWD.Drove the IS250 and the Acura today.  Yes, the IS250 is definitely tight on interior space as you noted, bplayer.  Not just the back seat (ridiculously little legroom), but headroom throughout -- and I'm only 5'9"" on a good day.  Having said that, the IS has all the features I want without paying extra for a bunch of features I don't want.  The heated AND ventilated seats are great, the push-button start is awesome (as with the G35x). The IS250 redesign is fantastic!  I found the pickup on the highway to be underwhelming -- and I wasn't looking for outrageous.  It felt like my Passat turbo would probably hold its own with the Lexus on a pull-out-and-pass test head-to-head.  The Lexus dealership setup was truly impressive -- the free carwashes, TV room, coffee bar, eat-off-the-floor service dept., massive fleet of service-loaner vehicles, pickup/dropoff service, etc. -- my daughter compared it to a Westin hotel.  The Acura had a great set of standard features.  I was amazed at the pricepoint with all those features included -- acknowledging, of course, that if it were an AWD it would likely be +/-$2k more.  Much roomier than the Lexus, closer to the G35x in interior space but not as luxuriously-appointed.  The dashboard gauges looked dated ('80s or '90s styling).  Despite the 3.2L V6 which is more than adequate for my purposes, it didn't have the power of the Infiniti.  My first car was a Honda and I love the Honda/Acura quality and reliability.  Both the Lexus and Acura handled rough roads firmly but not too stiff.  mnrep2, your experience is reminding me that I'm glad to be getting out of my Passat before the warranty expires.  I've already had to have my antenna replaced under warranty as well as the seat-heater (shorted out and burned my jeans!).  I wonder if Audis have similar reliability issues?Next up -- the bimmer and the A4.  Without driving it, on paper the 325xi looks like it'll require a number of options to compare to the others that will put it several thousand dollars higher.  I've got high hopes for the A4 -- expecting it to come in at a price-point and features that fit my budget and preferences (b/c I'll probably be willing to take the 2.0L instead of the 3.2L, a compromise that for me saves $$)."

I had an open mind and was open to all options including the G35 Coupe, IS350 the 330i and the A4. I drove all four. Before I took any test drives I was sure I wanted the Lexus. However, once I sat in it and started to drive I knew it was not for me. It felt soft, much like a large family car and the cockpit was very cramped as well as the steering wheel being too small. It has pretty good acceleration but did nothing to inspire me and clearly is not a drivers car.The 330i was very much a drivers car but I just didn't like the interior that much and truthfully didn't really like the snobby attitude at the dealership so that turned me off to them.The G35 had tons of torque but the little things really bugged me. For example the power seat controls being located up top and the interior didn't seem to have as high quality materials as the others I had driven. In addition the fuel economy leaves alot to be desired.My last stop was The Collection. They sell Ferrari, Porsche, Maserati and Audi. No sooner did I walk in when I was being offered coffee and pastrys. The dealership was gorgeous and the sales guy was a no b.s type of guy who I liked. I didn't really like the A4's I saw until I saw one with the S-Line package. Wow! what a looker. The interior was the finest I have ever sat in and it was tight and drove beautifully ( 2.0t , 6 spd). I was sold. I knew Audis depreciate horribly so leasing was the only option for me. They had a great 24 month lease program with 75% residual value and .00139 money factor. That simply cannot be beat. I am driving a 40k car with nothing down and $480 a month as well as free maintenance to boot. Trust me, I was never a fan of Audi but after driving all 4 there was no comparison. Just make sure you get the S line package.Good luck to all."

It is a great drive, but these boards continue to say never own outside of warranty.  Well, I can't accept that.  I put far too many miles on a car to be trading every 1.5 years.On the Passat - my wife has an '02 4-motion that has been a dream, but her friends had nightmares on the same car and traded within 6 months.  Not into roulette.On the XT, the owners say it is a great value, handles well and great $$$ value.  With their incentives you can out around 30K-32K depending on option load.  I did a check of used cars on carsdirect.com and there are a lot with 150K+ miles.

I do not think 330 is enough, I need 400Too many cars and engines will hurt your sales because of the huge overhead.Tell that to BMW, MB, Lexus, and Audi.  A 3.0 G35 with 240 hp would sell just fine.  A 3.5 with 320 would be the next bump.  Everybody but Acura and Infiniti exist using the dual engine sales model."

Given that gas may well rise to back to post-Katrina levels, it seems to make more sense to go for Lexus - with slightly higher MPG and a regular gas consumer to boot, sacrificing the slightly greater responsiveness of the TL.  Anyone care to weigh in on this?"

4651,"December  4, 2005  2:28AM",mwhitt,"i don't see any real difference on the MPG.  maybe you see something different than what Edmunds is showing.  so it comes down to premium vs regular, which is what $0.25 a gallon, if that.  what are you saving, couple of hundred a year if you are 15K a year driver.  if you're indifferent between the cars, go for the lower gas costs i guess.  i wouldn't think that if you can lay out over $30k out the door for a car, that this savings would mean a whole heck of lot.  i would say throw out the gas issue, and pick the car you like the most.  seems like a non-starter to me."
4652,"December  4, 2005  3:28AM",saigonboi21,"i dont get why you worry about gas prices. It's gone up for a while and people are still driving like crazy. The diff between 87 and 91 is $.20. that's only 2.50 diff for every 10 gallons. MPG also depends on how you drive as well. I can get better MPG in the TL than other ppl can in the ES. I think my 330i sucks a lot of gas but i dont complain. I mean if you're gonan spend 30-40k on a car, what's another $15 a month???"

That being said, yes you need only put in regular gasoline in the Lexus but to say that the Acura has only ""slightly greater responsiveness"" is a misstatement in my opinion. The TL although FWD, is in a different category than the ES as far as performance is concerned. BTW, are you prepared to spend 30,000-35,000 this year on a vehicle that is getting remodeled for 06?"

I would particularly emphasize that there is no ""slightly greater responsiveness"" of the TL over the ES.  It's significantly greater responsiveness IMHO.

Went to the Lexus dealership for a test drive. I live in Chicago and there was a dusting of snow on the ground - nothing remotely serious.    First strange thing: the guy coming in from his test drive remarks that the ""driver assist"" feature came on during his test drive. I didn't pay much attention. However, I was taking a pretty easy turn which would not have been a problem for my old Camry and the IS slipped on the turn causing the driver assist feature to kick in.   This disturbed me. I don't think (though I have little experience) the 330xi would have done that. Could this just be a tire issue or is this driver assist system screwed up?    Has anyone else experienced this with the IS, or has anyone driven the IS in snow? I like the features for price of the IS though it feels a little cramped, but I really liked the way the BMW drove. Felt very firm and controlled. However, it wasn't snowing when I test drove the BMW.   I have never owned either a lexus or a bmw. Thanks for any help or experience!Wiggling"

4664,"December  6, 2005  1:47PM",gordonwd,"I have a 325i, not xi, in the Detroit area and so far have gotten along OK with the standard all-season tires through one winter (although this year is looking like it could be a lot worse!). Anyway, my impression is that the more recent ""stability"" controllers are getting more sensitive and tend to kick in with very little slippage. In some cases I guess this is good, but I find that I often prefer turning off the DSC and letting the car spin its wheels and fishtail a little bit. With the DSC on, I had a couple instances of pulling out from a slippery side street onto a main road, when the DSC kicked in and caused the car to feel like the engine just bogged down big-time, and there I was trying to get into a moving flow of traffic with no power! I'd prefer a little wheelspin and I'm fully capable of keeping it moving in the right direction.   So don't let the stability control's kicking in unfairly color your opinion of either car (even though the BMW is the obvious choice   )."

They don't feel the engine stutter is a problem as they simply refuse to fix it.The coils, sensors and blown light bulbs were all considered no big deal as they're known issues with e46s.The broken e-brake from the factory was probably viewed as a factory default.

4671,"December 13, 2005  2:25AM",cdnpinhead,"I posted the following (in error) several days ago in the Luxury Performance Sedans board.  Apparently there are fewer manual transmission fans there than I thought.  Anyway, FWIW:A couple of years ago I learned that my present car (Lincoln LS) was going to be cut adrift -- it's not discussed here, but six years ago, we thought it was going to be quite something. Oh well. . . It'll good for the forseeable future, but in the next 6-30 months, I'll probably pull the lanyard on something different.  I have three requirements for my lux or ""near-lux"" car: 1) manual transmission, 2) rear-wheel drive, 3) must carry my bicycle inside (really big back seat, fold-down seatbacks or Avant style).  Then I have a few ""nice-to-haves"": good long-term reliability (100-200K miles), decent fuel mileage & dealers that have a clue regarding sports sedans & proper service.  The only three (lux or near-lux) vehicles on the planet that meet my requirements are the BMW 3, the BMW 5 and the G35 coupe. Given that, I compromised and added the IS250 (no fold-down seat), the A4 Avant (AWD) & the A3 (front-wheel drive) to my matrix. And, IMHO, the long-term reliability of both the BMW & Audi are suspect.  I tend to avoid bells & whistles, but still like some amenities: sport suspension/wheels/tires, upgraded audio & xenons; Homelink is simple & useful. I appreciate being able to select just what I want (German), though the Infiniti premium package covers most of what I want without too much fluff. I looked at the 330, since the upgraded audio & xenons were standard, but the extra dollars beyond that were wasted on me. I guess I don't crave the extra horsepower & much of the rest I care about even less.  Two that meet all my requirements (BMW 3 & G35 coupe) came within $40 of each other (sticker or invoice), set up the way I want. My present car has taught me that extra size and weight (as in the BMW 5) are of little value.  Hmmm . . . I yap a lot about Asian reliability, but the reality is that I could have a 325 for the same price as a G35 (in country). Since I'm more than willing to do the ED thing, the 325 starts to look even better. Plus which, Electric Red is just about the most attractive (to me) colour in the class. And, finally, Shipo has helped me come to grips with the concept that owning a BMW doesn't necessarily cause one to become a poseur and/or lower life form.  More later, as I review the last 3-5 pages of each of the brochures. Those tables are where the action is, for me -- the standard equipment & option packages take awhile to dissect & compare.Edit -- I may add the CTS to the mix.  More research is required, though I'm very reluctant to try yet another American franchise used to dealing only with people who have been in the AARP at least 15 years."

Still, I don't want ANOTHER one!!We already have an SUV, which gets used for toting the teenagers and their friends to soccer, etc. and for getting us up to the mountains on occasion.  So I need a daily commuter that I won't be embarassed to be seen getting out of in the corporate parking lot. Plus.....I simply can not drive a gas guzzler.  Because of the job I have, it would be inappropriate for me to drive something that gets 15 mpg and LOOKS like it is getting 15 mpg.  My current car passes the smell test (and does get 21 mpg).  But a Mustang wouldn't.  And I do get some grins, personally, by driving a fuel-efficient vehicle.  But that's just me. My only experience buying used was not a great one.  Yes, I ended up with a nicer car than I would have bought new.  But I did end up with maintenance issues that I would have been less likely to have if I bought new.

Yes, they are available, in the ~$400 range.What I've learned, given my need to store my bicycle inside the car, is that fold-down rear seats doesn't necessarily yield an acceptable result.  In an effort to improve torsional rigidity, some of the cars that advertise (& deliver) fold-down rear seats don't mention that the resulting hole isn't rectangular and as wide as the interior.  It's a rounded triangle that may (or may not) accept a bicycle, sans its front wheel.Renting the car to do a test isn't necessary.  Clean up your bike and take it to the dealer.  Try it.  That's my plan.The G35 coupe, which is either #1 or #2 on my hit parade on any given day (relative to the 325), has one of these triangular pass-throughs.  In due course, I'll determine whether it's adequate.

No joy.  I even looked at an X3 because it has the manual option and lots of room for the bike.In any event, I've got a matrix involving nine vehicles, of which only a few are real contenders -- BMW 3's (325 & 330) & the G35 coupe.If I wished to be whipped about the head and shoulders and disappointed yet again by an American brand that thinks it wants to compete, I'd add the two CTSs to the mix.

The 9-car matrix mentioned earlier (by me) has now become 11.Would I wish to be caught dead in a Mercedes?  No.  OTOH, I felt much the same about BMWs until recently, but for much different reasons.  I will attempt to be objective, but that Electric Red BMW 3 is calling me.  I'll buy enough insurance to get me to 100K, and if it's been a trooper to that point, then I'll go bare.My favourite road in the world upon which to evaluate cars is between Nevada & California in an area where almost no one goes.  There is a corner (RH) where the road drops away & if the car isn't up to it, people die.  I've done it in a 240Z, a 510, two different Miatas, an Eagle Vision, my Lincoln LS and . . . (wait for it) a Chevrolet BelAir.  Some of my cars have done much better than others.I think the 3 will eat it up.  I'm not so sure about the Merc.

I'm still puzzled about that.   My purpose in the post is to point out that MB is a good option.  Can't understand why so many people don't even consider it.  I never said the MB was head and shoulders over the BMW; its just so many others say the BMW is great - and never consider the MB.   I don't get it - they look darn close to me; with on paper a slight edge to MB for my needs. In my car searches, I drove Volvo for the last 15 years.  I've always been happy with them until my most recent purchase.  Visibility is poor; turning radius is much bigger than previous version.  So now I'm looking for a replacement.  I didn't really consider MB at first either, until I saw the C350/C280.  On paper, the new C-series fits what I'm looking for.

They charge sales tax on the depreciated portion of the car (i.e. the difference between the negotiated price of the car and the calculated residual).  Fortunately for me I got the car via the ED program and as such I only had to pay sales tax on about $14,000.  The unfortunate part was that I moved up here to New Hampshire not three months later, where there is no sales tax on cars (or any other sales tax for that matter), however, there is a vehicle tax applied by our town each year when you register it, so I got dinged for nearly $1,000 twice in 2002.  :-(Of course it's still pretty easy to justify living up here, consider the following:- Even with NJ's high property taxes, our property taxes went down about $3,000 per year by moving up here.  Advantage NH.- Our car insurance dropped about $500 per year.  Advantage NH.- Car tax difference are a wash for the first year of ownership and then anywhere from $500 to $1,200 annually for any make/model/year of vehicle that I'm likely to want to drive.  Advantage NJ.Balancing out the above three items I figure that we are about $1,500 ahead by living in New Hampshire, even with the annual vehicle tax.

WTF?  Maybe a 5 or 3 wagon could hold a bike.  A G35 coupe?  Did you try that?  I can't see how that's possible given the fact the G35's trunk is tiny and it's backseat is a torture chamber.  Given that, I compromised and added the IS250 (no fold-down seat), the A4 Avant (AWD) & the A3 (front-wheel drive) to my matrix.The A4 avant, A3 and Matrix seem realistic.  Might as well go Mazda3 - better handling than the other 3 and much better manual shifter too. The IS250 simply makes no sense given your bike requirement...the backseat in the IS250/350 is a joke.CTS...again, this seems weird with your bike requirement.  FWIW, I think the CTS and IS250/350 handle like pigs. Is this what you wanted?  I've driven all the cars you mentioned (some not at wagons though)."

In the winter, that built-in ski bag is really a nice feature and will hold two pairs of cross-country skis without having to fold the seats down.One other feature notable for bicyclists (and others): the E46, at least, has built-in roof-rack mounting points. I bought a Thule rack made especially for this car, so when my wife and I are going somewhere together to ride, it just takes a few short minutes to put the rack on with both bikes. I'm not sure if the E90 has these mounts -- it's not something that's listed in the brochures and I even owned the car for a while before I discovered them!"

My limit is 188"", due to my garage, so length is one of the first dimensions I check.   I guess it depends on your definition of luxury: are you looking for a ""luxury"" nameplate, or just ""luxurious"" amenities, like leather and power everything?In addition to the Mercedes C-class and BMW 3-series, the Volvo S40 and Audi A3 would meet your size requirement. I personally would be concerned with the reliability of those options and would lean more toward your choices from Lexus and Acura. If you're willing to do a coupe, you may want to look at the RSX, too. If you just want leather and other goodies, you may want to consider a Mazda 3, a Subaru Impreza or a Saab 9-2X (which is basically a gussied-up Impreza). Each of these can be had with leather, sunroof, upgraded audio, etc., while still meeting your length requirement.If a shorter length is truly a requirement you may also want to consider a small SUV (I know, it's probably blasphemy here and probably belongs on a different forum, but)--several choices would meet your requirement and add cargo capacity, too.My two cents: the IS250 is absolutely, hands down the most attractive car on the list!Best of luck and happy car hunting.Greg"

Push too hard and radical understeer rears its ugly head, but the car is easy to drive quickly and much more fun than we thought it would be.I didn't push hard enough to induce understeer, but otherwise I agree.

DSG was just as fun and snappy as ever.  Unfortunately, the car sits too high and the suspension causes too much understeer in hard cornering.  Nosedive was ample in corners and the car, due to the inherent problems of FWD, couldn't pull out of corners fast enough for me.

You admittedly drove the car sedately and then come back at me for tearing down the car's high speed performance characteristics?  As someone else mentioned, one man's taunt car is another's sloppy jallopy.  The 06 GLI, for people who drive as if medicated, will feel tight and fun.  I tend to push my cars far more: the end result then, most cars to me feel undrivable.  On my drive of the GTI the salesman was shocked that I didn't like the car.  He commented that nobody on his test drives has pushed the car as hard as I or as smoothly (he actually wanted to know if I race in auto-X or semi-professionally).  He expected I would have liked it given the way I drove it.  Nope.

Apparently it was picked up and put on a flat-bed or into a trailer, and this was a car with the alarm system installed.

Main issues for me were subpar gas mileage, smaller backseat, and design was a little on the plain side (although tasteful and simple.)This was my second choice to the Acura TL, TL was a better value proposition to me (even though it cost more), I liked the design, features, back seat room, etc...

The difference has to do with such arcane things as inter-axle & limited-slip differentials.I'm guessing you couldn't care less.  AWD is automatic and is generally the best choice for those who are mostly concerned with highway traction (as opposed to off-road stuff).  Subaru is the reigning king of this, but if you want ""luxury"" (however you define it -- there's lots of bickering potential here), the BMW & Audi options are good ones, and some are willing to admit that the Infiniti G can play too.  I've spent quite a bit (but not nearly enough) of my life in Colorado, and I can assure you that the most common vehicle driven by locals in the ""high country"" (above 8000 feet -- say Winter Park/Fraser/Granby) is the Subaru.Audi has been doing this longer than anyone, and has the best (bar none) interiors in the business.

We're tempted to blame that on such features as the Lexus's electronic throttle, which uses sensors on the gas pedal and computerized engine controls to replace the cable that usually connects the driver's foot to the engine. Or maybe it's the fact that the IS 350 isn't available with a manual transmission. (We had a lot of fun driving a BMW 3 Series with its manual option.) But those answers seem too simple. After all, we've enjoyed driving cars with automatics -- or even models with too much electronic wizardry -- when a winning vehicle lies beneath the gadgets.

Many will argue that rdw or fwd is all you need (and not without merit).  My preference was to sacrifice the 2-3mpg and power (yes, it is a noticable difference if you drive with any spirit).  W/ rwd or fwd, you will do much better w/ snow tires.  You will likely be better off with tires designed for ice and snow than M+S or A/S for winter driving (assuming you keep it on the road), although they often have a softer tread compound making them wear quicker.I have not really noticed a back and forth oversteer/understeer , or maybe I'm just used to it as I have been driving 4wd and AWD for years and may unconsciously compensate for it (or use it to my advantage).Cost is a disadvantage although the level of the impact can be argued if you choose to run two sets of tires and consider the resale value the AWD will have.  I beleive here has been a whole discussion on that subject.  Cost is also subjective if you are considering multiple vehicles like Subaru vs 3-Series or C-series or whatever.

4838,"January 27, 2006  9:10PM",nybmwguy,"Here is a provactive comment.  There are essentially two cars in this segment to buy from.  All others are a waste unless you get an incredible deal.  Agree or disagree?1.  BMW 3 series.  Price the 325xi to a comparable Mercecedes C240 or Audi A4 2.0 and you find best value for what it offers (especially with new maintenance program that effectively brings the price down a bit more and if you opt for leatherette in price comparison).  I like Audi, but not discounted sufficiently for its poorer record in quality and lower resale value.  Comparably equipped car is only slightly cheaper and not worth the savings.  Audi and Mercedes don't have a single attribute over the 3 series in this category (though i prefer E o4 A6 to 5 series and S or A8 to 7-series). 2. Acura TL.It is a blah car, but great quality, power and interior.  No option pricing, reliable, reasonably stylish.  G35 was ""the"" other car in this segment, but I can't see what the G35 has over the new TL and again, the TL is close in price so why go Inifiniti (If you love Infiniti beg, borrow and steal to get into the M35).Volvo S60 - not comparable, underpowered, weaker quality, image, etc.Saab 93 - nice, but a level under and comparable to a TSX.Lexus I350 - not fun, cheap looking interior (to me), nothing compellingInfiniti G35 - Buy the TL for same power and nicer quality (G35 coupe would be an exception for this rule if you are coupe person)Audi A4- again, buy the 3 series for slightly more and make it back in service coverage, resale value and quality (also, interior is great quality, but seems dated).  BMW now has a reasonably proficient 4wheel drive system so quatro less key.Mercedes C- too expensive, too many cut corners.  Buy the E used or go for the BMW.Cadillac -  not a bad car, but not compelling.  Not cheap enoughLincolen Zephyr - same price as ANY of the above and weaker than all of them."

I live in the north, have never put snowtires/chains on my cars and have never been stuck. If it is really horrible, don't go out, otherwise drive carefully and remember that just because you can go doesn't automatically mean you can stop (for all you four wheel drivers).

I heard that BMW would need to fully redesign a block to make it 3.5 L instead of 3.0. the current 3.0 comes from successive evolutions from the original 2.5 to 2.8 then 3.0. Should a 3.5 be redeveloped, the overall block length increase would compromise crash test ratings, so it seems 3.0 is a limitation difficult to overcome in this context.If BMW want to switch to v6, increasing displacement will be easier, and this is what MB did.but straight 6 have some advantages that V6 don't have (balance), so I prefer straight 6 myself. Because of this, BMW may directly switch to V8 for their top end."

4849,"February  2, 2006  7:35AM",brightness04,"I said: The key is not ""high value"" but inflated MSRPYour response: You're splitting hairs. Inflated MSRP implies a value judgement. Buying a car is a value judgment, the price is the price. It costs what it costs to you the consumer.  No personal value judgement was implied in my use of the term ""inflated MSRP"" at all.  ""Inflated MSRP"" means an MSRP that is far higher than actual market clearing price.  For example:MB E class with $5-7k manufacturer lease incentive, that indicates an inflated MSRP.Another example:both TL and 9-5 sell for about $31-32k in the market place; they are by definition comparable in ""value.""  Yet, one of them has an MSRP of $39k, whereas the other is around $34k.  The $5k difference is sheer ""inflated MSRP"" that does not accrue at all in terms of ""value.""  In more than half of the 50 states, the inflated MSRP gets taxed every year of a car's ownership."

I am dreaming of this six in line with a compressor or a turbo with minimum lag. If BMW added some direct fuel injection, they could even improve economy like Volkswagen did for the 2.0 TFSI.300 HP, 280 LBF, this would make an interesting offer.

4853,"February  9, 2006  4:28AM",dhamilton,"The comparison that Edmunds did on the A4 vs 330 is almost completely different from the recent road&track comparo. I know they are comparing two different cars in the bimmer catagory but if you look at just numbers, and the fact that the A4 for road&track was equipped with far better tires, it would seem as though the A4 stacks up a little better, than Edmunds would make out. {actually a whole lot better} Granted the tires are a huge issue and you can go so far as test {track }conditions to forgive the big disparity. That's why it's best to drive cars for yourself and make your own judgments. One other point is that IMO Audi has a key ingredient that BMW lacks. That being a certain driver friendly something where you can drive an Audi all day and never get beat up. They are much more forgiving as a GT car IMO Also sosk, I live in Houston where we probably get more rain but much less ice. A good set of tires for the appropriate season will go a long ways on any car. That, with adjusting driving habits when the weather turns foul should keep you safe  Finally, I recommend driving as many of the cars in your ""needs"" category as possible to see which one fits you best. I would recommend a Japanese brand if you intend to keep the car for 13 years as you did your last one.  Good luck and let us know how you do."

For reference, she's mid 20's, an accomplished athlete, graduated last year with a master's degree in biomedical engineering.  She had been driving an Toyota Celica and occasionally her older brother's restored Alfa Graduate, but decided it was time to get a new car.  She and her brother took a Skip Barber's driving school together about 2 years ago.  So I guess she qualifies as an ""enthusiast"".  I am cutting and pasting her comments below:______________________________________1st place:  330i 6-speed:  Overall, most fun to drive of the 4 door sedans.  Not a fan of I drive, but it was not as bad as I had read.  Unfortunately, expensive options and not much price negotiation. 2nd place:  TL 6-speed:  Biggest positive surprise.  Handling was better than expected, considering front wheel drive.  Nice 6-speed that was crisper shifting than even the 330i.  Some torque steer.  Sporty, clean interior, nice amenities.  Very reasonably priced and no BS option list.3rd Place:  G35 Coupe 6-speed.  Sedan exterior is a turnoff.  Coupe is much nicer outside, but still a dissapointment inside.  Powerful engine, but noisy and  unrefined at high rpms compared to the 330i and TL.  Close to BMW relative to steering / handling.  No rear seat headroom. 4th Place:  Lexus IS350.  Biggest negative surprise.  No manual transmission?  Not even an SMG option?  What was Lexus thinking?  Salesman claimed that I was ""exactly"" the target market they were shooting for.  Yeah, right.  Girls can't drive sticks.  I said it looked to me like the ""target market"" was testosterone laden guys that have a lead foot and no other driving skills.  Too bad.  Nice powerful engine, decent handling, best interior, but thanks to automatic transmission, least fun car to drive.         5th Place:  A4 3.2.  Attractive but a little bland exterior.  Nice interior.  Performance was ho-hum.  Felt very heavy.  Reliability an issue.6th Place:  C350.  Everything 2-3 rungs below the 330i, plus terrible reliability record. I'll either go for the 330i or, perhaps, the TL with the idea that if things go well financially, I might go for the new M3 in a couple of years.  What do you think?______________________________________There you have it from one prospecitve buyer who is considerign the entire compact sports sedan market."

As I approached, I was thinking that I hoped the occupants didn't ding my door with their little car.  I was surprised when it turned out to be a new 3-series.  It was only the second I had seen in person, the first was from the rear on the road.  I was struck by how small it seemed and its lack of presence next to my G35.  The styling is not attractive to me, and the rear is especially bad.  Add to that the fact its way overpriced and it's definitely out as an option when my lease is up in June.  I would not even consider the TL because of the FWD HondaAccord platform and the quality issues my friend has had with his (headliner falls down, paint falls off, etc.)  The Lexus shotcomings are as you mentioned - it will probably steal some sales from BMW automatic buyers -its styling and size seem similar to the BMW.  While the Infiniti coupe is a great looking car, I like the practicality and convenience of the sedan, and IMHO I think the sedan looks better for a sedan than the coupe does for a coupe.  I was going to test drive the new 3-series, but that is no longer necessary. It may handle a litte better than the G35, but so does a go cart, and it's not enough better to make a difference when size, styling, and other factors are considered. I am looking forward to a 2007 6MT G35(or G37?)sedan, but I'll exercise my purchase option or get a short lease on a 2006 if I can't get the 2007 before I have to turn my 2003 6MT in.

I was and am really somewhat upset that I find no other alternatives attractive at this time.  I did not say that there were no alternatives for others, only that there are none for ME at this time who wants a 6MT sedan (not a coupe), in the right size for me (not too big, not too small), etc.  If price were no object and a coupe was desired my First Choice would be an M3 and that is just the right size for that type of car.

I don't think I criticized anyone elses opinion and did not expect to get flamed for apparently having the ""wrong"" opinion.

My ""opinion"", which is of course, a ""Fact"" to me and ONLY me.  ;-)Regarding your comparison of the 3-Series and A4 vis-à-vis the other cars in their lineup, that doesn't really hold water either.  Why?  Simply because the Audi A8 and A6 redesigns typically happen before the A4 (just as the 3-Series was the last BMW to be Bangalized).  That having been said, Audi has a history of ""Face Lifting"" the A4 just prior to a complete redesign, and this seems to be the case here as well, given that an all new A4 is due out next year.  As such, I think you've jumped the gun in your analogy by several months at the very least.Best Regards,Shipo"

I didn't like the way it handled, lots of body roll & too softly sprung my tastes (The copious use of I & my denotes this is in fact an opinion, not fact).As far as the stick thing goes, Lexus offers a manual in the IS250, it wouldn't hurt for them to put one in the IS350.  If they don't sell, just yank it from production after the first 2 years.  Simple as that.  BMW, Audi, MB, Acura, Cadillac, Infiniti all offer 3 pedal versions of their respective cars in this segment.

Gives the car next to my left plenty of room and (usually) takes me out of range of thier passenger door.  Did that in the corner of a restaurant parking lot on Saturday.  Came out to find the only other car in the section, a FX35, immediately on my left a full two feet into my parking space, making it impossible for me to open my door wide enough to access the back seat.  Intentional, who knows?  But as I was loading both of my kids into the back from the passenger side, guy pulls up in a utility van and says ""looks like you need help"".  He then pulls in tight next to the drivers side of the Infiniti with about 3"" to spare and has his buddy back into the space I'm vacating.  There was no way anyone was getting inside that Infiniti except through the rear hatch.  Not something I would encourage in front of my kids, but I definitely got a kick out of it."

No reason ever for anyone to be even close to my car...but somehow they find themselves there and batter the heck out of my car....sometimes I think my car must be a big magnet that just pull other cars in wherever I park.For whatever reason, cars that are conspicuously parked far away become a target for animosity.... I think some people viewed it as ""snobby"" and assume the owner thinks ""my car is so good that it doesn't deserve to be near the commoners' cars.""  Whether that is the owner's intent or not, some other driver just have to lash out and be jerks.Obviously the car being parked far away isn't hurting anyone.  In fact, it actually leaves more closer spaces open!  It's really a cowardly act since there is often a low likelyhood that they'll get caught... Oh well...  :confuse:"

My take on it is the majority who park close to you in those far away spots do so because they also want to get away from the ones that don't care about door dings and feel you may be considerate enough to not ding their car.  With that said, there are still some idiots out there that aren't considerate and want to park next to a nice vehicle just to annoy you - although I believe they are far and few between simply because they are too lazy to walk"
4964,"April  4, 2006  9:54PM",newcarman,Anyone have any info on the new 2007 G35 sedan>>??  When will the car be available at dealers??How much redisgned will be be over the existing G35?? I hope its better!!!!!!!!!! even though i like this car too.I want to buy a G35 sedan but the main question is should i wait to when the 2007 comes out or go with the present G35. Any ideas people??
4965,"April  4, 2006 10:27PM",dewey,Patience is a virtue in this case. Wait. I am sure the new G37 will be far more exciting in terms of performance/handling than the current model.
4966,"April  5, 2006  2:34AM",reasanaii,Plus the interior...rumor says that it will be somewhat closer to the new M serieswhich is awesome...

It had a 3-digit license plate so I know it was a tester.  It was diamond graphite/black leather and the exterior looked similar to the 06 G35 Sedan except it had dual exhaust outlets (like the 06 G35 Coupe) and a roof mounted antenna similar to the current BMW 3Series.  I had a quick glanced at the interior (limited visibility) and it had a Navi similar to the 06 G. If this was going be the 07 model, it would be the coolest G35 Sedan to date, IMO.  Sorry wasn't able to snap a picture"
4968,"April  5, 2006  3:28AM",vchiu,But the 330i Touring is on the European Price list already. Do you mean BMW don't plan to import it to Canada/US!?  This wouldn't be smart. The touring is much more practical and does not force you to go for a heavier X3!
4969,"April  5, 2006  5:49PM",dewey,You are correct.Unfortunately the only way I can own a 330i Touring is to immigrate to Europe. And here in N. America the X3 or X5 are not my kind of vehicles since I live and work in downtown and always drive on paved city roads/highways.
4970,"April  6, 2006  2:09AM",vchiu,"I can't Get it. if the 330i is imported already, then getting an import/road licence for the Wagon version should be possible souldn't it? How can BMW N/A can overlook this? isn't it possible to import upon one-off order or through a ""European Delivery"" programme?For me, the wagon is a simple variation of the Sedan (size and weight very close) how wouldn't it be possible to import the wagon?? This is a real deal breaker, as the Wagon is sooo practical in comparison to the Sedan ( I moved coutless of stuff and have kids) without compromising the handling and performance/mpg too much.X3 is 250Kg too heavy and has low MPG. Don't even mention X5. 7/S/A8 have MUCH better MPG with same powertrains. No need to further comment"
4971,"April  6, 2006  2:38AM",runningmom,"Hi.  this is a great website.  glad I found it.  My husband and I decided we need to get another car given my outback can't be in two places at the same time and his '67 MGB--WHICH HAS BEEN IN THE GARAGE SINCE WE GOT MARRIED--isn't about to leave it soon, at least not in my lifetime.  So as we were about to sign on the dotted line for an Avalon last weekend, we came to our senses in time and decided we weren't ready for the grave yet.  So what do you buy when you don't want to end up with the babyboomers version of your parents' Pontiac?  A G35coupe of course.  Since this is a website for owners, surely you'll understand the logic.  I haven't seen much discussion about the 06, so I'm hoping someone can enlighten me.  Have the paint problems been resolved?  have they upgraded the rotors?  I am completely confused about the tires.  I know we will need to buy snows--we live in Boston, and I've been traumatized since driving school a million years ago about hydroplanning in the rain, so what's the best  tire strategy.  Since I can't read a map, I like the idea of a nav system, but I don't like it that my husband can't reprogram it while I'm driving.  Does this mean i should get a Magellean at Costco and defile the  dash with it?  Biggest question, and one that's been asked in another forum I think, should we wait until the 07 come out (and when is that?).  We're planning on leasing.  I'm thinking we should go ahead with the 06, allow time for the problems in the 07 to surface, and trade in for the 08, or something like that. Is there conventional wisdom about this?Please advise.  Thanks."
4972,"April  6, 2006 11:38AM",mnrep2,"The paint is soft on most new cars,although it sounds like some posters have run into a relatively small batch of G35's that have problems with the clear coat.  You would need snow tires with the coupe.  Stay away from the G NAV option.  For that money there are much better aftermarket solutions.  The brake problems were nothing more than high performance pads that shed a lot of dust and wore out quickly.  The 06 models have gone to a different type of pad.  The new coupe will be out in 2007.  If you did a two year lease now you could get the next generation model after it has been on the market for a year  Why don't you look at and then test drive the G35x.  You have AWD, (when you need it) four doors and pretty great performance and handling.  I own a 05 X and love it.  The only option I wish I didn't buy was the NAV, otherwise I am very pleased with this car."

I believe in the USA  the BMW ED programme is restricted to cars that are sold in US dealerships.Nobody in this forum seems to share our views on wagons. And that is not so bad for you as it is for me since I am on the wrong side of the ocean.I love the European selection of  turbodiesels and wagons. In this continent there is very little buyer interest for such vehicles.When you say the word wagon or hatchback, many here think of their father's Ford LTD station wagon or their mother's Chevy Vega .And the word diesel arouses thoughts of those horrendous GM diesels that were sold in the 80s.At least MB and Audi provides a wider selection of wagons than the pitiful selection from BMW."

4983,"May  6, 2006  6:06AM",primetime79,"Let me preface my post by unequivocally stating the mere facts. I am not an automobile professional. I have no loyalty to any automobile manufacturer. I enjoy a exhilirating driving experience.Three years ago (2003), I was in the market for a sedan that had a certain level of sport and luxury. I narrowed my search to four cars. 1.) BMW 330I 2.) Audi A4 1.8T 3.) Lexus Is 300 4.) Infinity G 35 . Quickly this search was down to two as the Lexus IS 300 had absolutely nothing to offer in the form a luxury offering and the Infinity was much of the same although not to Lexus extreme. The ""feel"" of the steering wheel and all other components of the Inifity made it quite apparent that the build quality of this car was not up to par. So it was down to two cars, The BMW 330I and the Audi A4 1.8T. The 330I was much faster than the A4, but to me it lacked the handling prowlness of the A4. Maybe it's me, but the 330I was not impressive at all. I felt like it was a regular family sedan. I have nothing against BMW, but sometimes I wonder if sometimes their maybe a little bit of brainwashing or speaking something to existent, with the over hyped driving (handling) experience. For me it came down to the getting the best car for ME. The A4 exemplified te best handling (feedback), the best interior. The build quality on this car was impeccable. Unfortunately due to circumstance beyond my control (wife) I had to trade in my Audi a year ago for a SUV. Fast forward to the present, and I have been blessed to make the same purchase decision again. Again it came down to the eact same 4 cars with a little thought given to the Acura TSX. But after a close up encounter with the TSX , while the car is a phenomenal value it was apparent is was nothing more than that a ""phenomenal value"". So i test drove the same 4 cars again. The Infinity now with the 6MT was a nice car but lacked in the same area interior refinement and the short throw clutch felt like my brothers 95 Mitsubishi Eclipse (cheap). Next on the list was the Audi. The new Audi A4 had undergone some minor changes most notably HP improvement. Overall the car was better than the one I once had, but suprisingly was 6k more similiarly equipped. This posed a problem. It was then down to two cars the IS 350 and the 330I. Lots of people do not like the new 330I exterior. But I think while it may not be a sporty as the IS per se, it is definielty more profounding and unique. As usual when I went for my test drive of the BMW i walked into the dealership and was treated as an outkast. I guess this car either sells itself, or I did not look like the typical BMW client ready to make a purchase. In my usual car shopping attire I wore shorts, flip flops and a white wife-beater shirt with my bling bling on. Finally someone came to help me and I was in the BMW 330I. First glance of the 330I interior I did know what to think. After 30 seconds of looking at it, this understated interior started looking growingly bland. Once on the road, I could not figure out what all this Hoopla was about. Immediately I went straight to Lexus dealership to figure out what changes Lexus made to the IS. At first glance I fell in love with it's beauty. I then told the sales person order me a black on black with navi, but it has to be manual. It was at that time my heart was broken. No manual for 350. Never had I ever thought, I would own a sports/luxury car that was not manual. But the sales person was adamant that I at least try it out. The rest is history. I am a proud owner of a IS 350 Crystal White Navi. This car is not only super quick but handles excellent. I have driven it several times with the VDIM off and it makes a huge difference. Around corners with the VDIM on it cuts the throttle to quickly. I must advise the average driver to be careful, because this is a RWd car and they tend to spin out rather quickly. But after two weeks of owning it I am extremely ecstatic about my decision. I personally think BMW might be overhyped, Audi are underpowered, Infiiniti are built with less interior refinement and overall build quailty. Lexus Is 350 for me at least is the perfect blend, if you do not want to buy the car do not test drive it!!!!!!!!!p.s sorry I am a little long winded"
4984,"May  6, 2006  8:16AM",pgsmith,"My experience @ BMW was similar.  Obviously I did not conform to their image of a BMW owner having worn a t-shirt and shorts into their showroom.  They wasted no time in regaling stories of who they knew when I explained where I worked (Ho-hum, I was there to see the vehicles).  After we spent (too much) time in the the salesman's cubicle, I learned they did not have a car with the equipment they learned I might be wanting, but they would happily order it for me.I said great, but I wanted to actually drive a car to see if the car was really what I would like.  I was told that:1.  They did not even have a car that had an automatic (wife's requirement, not mine) I could test drive (which I saw later the same day on the lot). :confuse: 2.  They would not let me test drive a red car since I was not interested in red and that would put miles on a car someone else would buy. :confuse:3.  They had a blue one waiting to be prepped.  When I indicated that it might be OK to accept blue, The vehicle was not prepped even within a week, at which point I had to ""make them"" let me test drive the red one. :confuse: End results:1.  I was offended by their arrogance. :mad: 2.  I was not very impressed by the vehicle.3.  I bought a competitors vehicle (C280), which I am happy with.4.  I will continue to vehicle shop in the future in shorts, jeans, t-shirts, flip-flops, running shoes, as this will help me decide about they ability of the dealership to be confident in the car not try to sell the ""image"".5.  I will leave immediately any dealer who gives me this type of treatment in the future."
4985,"May  6, 2006 12:26PM",redsoxgirl,"I respect your right to have the opinion that the IS350 is the right car for you, but I strongly disagee that it is even close to the ""best luxury/sport sedan"" on any objective basis.Clearly you have a different definition of ""sport"" than I do as it pertains to how a car accelerates, handles, steers, brakes, performs - as well as how connected to the road and driver it is.  As evidence:The 330I was much faster than the A4, but to me it lacked the handling prowlness of the A4.How anyone could conclude the ""handling prowess"" of a 60/40 imbalanced FWD A4 is superior to that of the 50/50 balanced RWD 330i is an enigma.  Are you sure you weren't overly enamored with the interior of the A4 to forget to put it through a serious test drive against the 330i?    Never had I ever thought, I would own a sports/luxury car that was not manual. But the sales person was adamant that I at least try it out. The rest is history.Again, perhaps having come out of a 170 hp A4, you were enamored with the 300+ hp IS350.  But that automatic transmission removes any ""sport"" there might have been in the car for me.  Sorry, drag racing doesn't fit my driving style.  I have never owned a BMW and I am not sure I ever will.  But in searching for a compact to mid size sport sedan to replace my Boxster S this fall, the IS350 doesn't make the long list, let alone the short list on the ""sport"" criteria.  Great little luxury car, perhaps.  True sport sedan compared to the 3-series, no way.  At least not for me."

The car has excellent steering feel.  My only complaint is the VDIM killing the throttle to early when the wheel starts losing traction. I guess I am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the IS wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the BMW handles/feels/brakes better and declare them a winner.
4987,"May  6, 2006  4:11PM",redsoxgirl,"Just ought of curiousity. Have you ever test driven the IS 350 before. Because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter smooth.Yes, I've driven the IS350.  My cousins own a Lexus dealership and they will sell me one (or any Lexus model) for their cost, so I had hoped to like it.  The IS350 is a decent automatic.  But it's an automatic.  It's probably better  than BMW steptronic, comparable to the Mercedes/AMG ""manumatic"" and not as good as the Porsche tiptronic.  And I would never own one of those.  I wouldn't even be happy with the BMW M3 ""SMG"" transmission.  It's not an ""objective"" performance thing for me, it's a subjective feel, control and driving enjoyment.  If you are enough of a ""driver"" to have tested the limits of the VDIM and don't like that interference, I am surprised you don't agree, but that's your perogative. I am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the IS wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the BMW handles/feels/brakes better and declare them a winner.I think your curiosity stems from thinking that 2 or 3 objective performance measures capture the entire essence of driving feel and enjoyment - and even true performance - for everybody.  Gross oversimplification.  As a management consultant, I spend 60 hours a week boiling down complex business strategy and financial issues to a few spreadsheets, graphs and Power Point slides.  But at the end of the day, I can immediately tell you what executives ""get it"" and what ones don't, by how much they go behind the numbers rather than focus on them.  So the last thing I'm going to do is pick my next car by looking in the back of Car and Driver or Road and Track at a bunch of statistics without spending a lot of time in the drivers seat froming my own subjective opinions."
4988,"May  6, 2006  5:50PM",primetime79,"Apparently we have a few things in common as I too am a financial/management professional (Senior Investment Analyst).  I honestly felt exactly the same way you did about automatics before I test drove the IS 350.  This is the first automatic I have ever owned.  The reason I don't have any significant issues with the VDIM is because it only comes into play when I feel like driving the car to it's limit (2% of the time).  And besides as I mentioned you can easily turn it off in 15 seconds by starting the car with the parking brakes then tapping the brakes twice then the park brakes twice then the brakes twice.  This takes no more than 15 seconds.I love my 350 dearly, however my first choice would have been the M3 if I was only patient enough to wait for the new M3 to come out."

The dealer talked me into trying automatic (i was very surprised they don't have manual with this engine). After getting into it I saw nice pad-shifters and was prepared for a good impression. But after a minute a realized that you can't control CURRENT gear of your car - you only limit your MAXIMUM gear. you don't even know the gear that's currently on! My current automatic Subaru Legacy(165hp) is more sportier in that aspect (it always shows the actual gear that's on). I can't say anything about handling - I simply hadn't got that far with a test drive. It's a luxury, but not anywhere near sport regardless of numbers. Someone at Lexus should be fired for that type of design."

And molasses slow.  Try a double downshift at 65 with the tranny in 6th.  That move - i'd really go triple most of the time - takes 5 seconds in the IS350.  It was excrutiating.  I wanted power...the computer didn't want to give it to me.The car has excellent steering feel.If you like numb, then yes, it's excellent.  If you want to feel the road through the wheel, the IS350 is too isolated.

I find the e90's exterior bland.  Doesn't matter...I don't buy for how it looks on the outside.  The interior's okay - but it's not driver centric enough.  The place where the e90 shines against the current competition - balance, handling, driver-feedback.  Driving, there's no other sport sedan that feels the same right now.  Or better.  Bummer.  At 140+ on the autobahn my e90 feels buttoned down and lets me know everything going on.  That makes the car worth owning.  Drive the Is350 hard and it becomes really clear it's not a sport sedan.  It's a luxury cruiser with a big engine.The 07 G35 may finally be some competition for the 330i.  Of course the 07 335i with 300 hp and 300 ft-lbs of torque from 1400-5000rpm will be hard to be in any fashion."

4994,"May  7, 2006  3:06AM",laurasdada,"Having never driven one because of the following, imho:Credit to Caddy for beginning to define/redefine itself with the CTS.  However, the overdone, unattractive exterior and cheap looking, disjointed in design interior along with the window sticker sent me quickly on my way the first time I encountered the CTS.  Now, I may be missing a great ride, but I truly enjoy a nicely styled exterior and an interior that suits me is a must.  While the interior does not have to be of the ultimate in materials, I do want a logical and attractive layout (as a reference, Audi and Lexus do interiors right in my book) as, of course, that is where I spend my time driving.  The CTS (which may have been upgraded since last I looked?) I found quite lacking, especially given the asking price.  But, I find all Cadillac models a bit aggressive in their prices.  Hence rebates and ""Employee Pricing...""I chose the Acura TL as FWD is not a four letter word to me.  I grew up with FWD (Saab, Honda, Mitsu, Renault!, VW...) and appreciate the snow country advantage (New Englnader & avid skier).  I believe that Honda/Acura produces the best handling FWDs out there (and I know some RWD afficionados would consider that statement an oxymoron!) which suits me just fine.  I may lose out to RWD at 9 or 10/10ths, but that is really just not an issue to me.  In my comparison shopping, the TL offered the best combo of style, luxury, sport, economy, power and value.Maybe the next CTS will be a more suitable candidate."
4995,"May  7, 2006  6:41AM",corvettefan427,"The new CTS should address the current models interior. Based on spy photos I've seen, and a review I read from a journalist who saw the car and described the interior as outstanding. As far as the exterior, if you don't like Caddy's styling theme, you probably still won't like the new one, although I think now that the styling has been introduced, it may be slightly more ''organic'' for 2008, although it's hard to tell."

4997,"May  7, 2006  9:43AM",davids5,"I am not sure that most people are on the same page here. Most people may have their own definition of what a sport sedan is and what sporty driving is. Working for the USAF in Europe, active duty and civilian duty I feel that I have a good idea of what sporty driving and what a sports sedan is. have almost 23 years of driving experience in Europe and 20 of them in Germany.To me sporty driving isn't 0-60 spurts or 1/4 mile drag races,probably most of these so called sport sedans are not even equipped with the proper tires for high speed sporty driving. While most Americans come over here for the first time with their so called sport sedans and wagens and think 80mph is fast when driving well over 100 mph is a daily and normal ocurance over here.You dont see American Ford, GM,Honda,Toyota,etc burning up the track.Many ruin there vehicles or even kill themselves trying to keep up and prove something against the real high speed and sport vehicles like MB,BMW,Audi-VW (VAG)and of course Porsche.I feel that most have been brain washed and are easily sold on bells and sirens,dodads and smoke and mirror tricks that really dont do a thing for true performance and true longevity of a vehicle. I dont give a damn if one car has a better DVD-CD changer than the other car or has 20 cup holders.Our American car industry needs to start building good solid dependable vehicles starting with high powered engines that dont spend most of its time at the garage or at the gas station because its such a gas hog.Off base here in Germany a gallon of gas cost $6.86.They build powerfull engines over here that use very little gas and last and gives you years of satisfaction......"

Blueguydotcom is right, this is a painfully slow downshifting transmission for anyone who really prefers the control of picking their own gear at any time.But even with a manual transmission, I still think the suspension and steering feedback are a couple of rungs down from BMW.  I hate to say it - because I don't like the car - but the G35 was better in that regard.Lastly, re-read your ""15 second solution"" to overly interfering VDIM.  Porsche has a button.  BMW has a button.  This is not a solution from a comapnay that has any serious intention of backing up their ""sport"" marketing with the real thing.The Lexus IS350 is a nice car for someone other than me."
4999,"May  7, 2006  2:39PM",fedlawman,"""To me sporty driving isn't 0-60 spurts or 1/4 mile drag races""I tend to agree with you for the most part, but I don't think you can generalize ""Americans"" as a whole. Historically, Europeans have placed a higher value on handling than straight-line speed, but things have changed today. American cars today handle as well as they accelerate, and todays European cars have placed an emphasis on 0-60 and 1/4 mile performance - why do you think that is?The roads here are different, as are the laws (because our society is different). As a result, driving is different here. So, while I agree overall that European cars tend to perform better than American cars, let me play devil's advocate here and consider some current American cars - Although they're not my cup of tea personally, I could go to a dealer tomorrow and purchase a 2006 Corvette or Cadillac STS for less than $40,000. Are they as good as the European ""equivalent?"" Not likely, but they are outstanding cars in their segment and cost 1/2 to 1/3 the price of a ""comparable"" European car. The Corvette may not have the elegance and refinement of a Porsche 911, but on a twisty road or racetrack, they're pretty comparable. Both are rewarding to drive and own in their own way - a personal choice. The Cadillac vs. Mercedes is a similar comparison. I've been driving an S-Class Mercedes for 2 years now (company car) and, while it is a very substantial car and suprememly comfortable, it's not at all rewarding to drive from a performance perspective. It floats over the road with light, overboosted steering, and rolls hard in corners. I haven't driven the Cadillac, but I can't imagine it's significantly worse than the M-B.So, while I personlly prefer and own European cars (I have an E30 BMW M3 and a Volvo V70), I can understand why someone might enjoy the performance and personality of American cars for what they offer the driver - especially on our poorly maintained, poorly designed American roads."

I realize that nothing I buy in sedan or coupe format is going to match the driving experience I now enjoy with a real sports car.  But I'm also not looking for the ""luxury"" side to be at the expense of the ""sport"" side.  I have driven a friend's previous generation BMW M3 sedan  and it would fit my bill.  And it ""only"" has 240 horsepower, 60+ short of the IS350, but the true overall performance (given what I'm looking for) is miles above the Lexus.

5001,"May  7, 2006  5:29PM",allargon,"This is somewhat off-topic discussing European vehicle superiority, but nearly every manufacturer you mentioned has a horrible reliability record.  MB, VW and Audi are notorious.  20 years ago American cars had horrible reliability ratings.  Most don't think that is the case now.  Buick and Cadillac surpass Infiniti and Acura in quality according to JDP.  European cars (and maybe Chinese cars) are now the ones known for lacking reliability.  What good is the great driving ability of the car if it's always in the shop?Back to the topic, I love the exterior styling of the CTS.  If you want an exterior that doesn't offend (or provoke any emotion), the Infiniti G35 sedan is for you.  The exterior of the new 3 series doesn't do it for me, but it provokes emotion.Unless one wants to spend a significant amount of moolah aftermarketing the interior of the CTS (or even the G35), the current kings of the segment seem to be the IS350 and the 3 series.IMHO, value wise the CTS, G35 and the TL are the leaders of the cars in this segment as they are midsize vehicles compared to the compacts that are the A4, the 3 series, the C class and the Lexus IS.  They are on the lower end of the price scale, too as the CTS and G35 both dip into the high 20's.(Anyone know why the Saab 9-3 and the Jaguar X-type aren't subjects for this forum?)"

But given the lackluster competition, it's tough to see how I could opt for milquetoast (IS350, A4) over fun.  Maybe the 07 G35 - much better interior, better engine, supposedly bettersuspension - will be the competition the 3 series has lacked for over 20 years.

The interior is simply amazing (unless you are stuck in the back).  I suspect, and hope, that the 325 will handle a bit sharper, and be a bit quicker (it better, it has 8 years on the Audi, and much fatter tires).

I have driven both the BMW 330, 325, and both Audi engines [2.0T, 3.2.] To me the clutch in the BMW is rubbery and feels a bit vague as to when it's going to engage/disengage. I do think that there was better road feedback with the steering wheel but the downside to that is a nervousness that while on the track might be ok, but for daily driving is tiresome. I think the seats in the Audi were far superior. The thing is, bimmers are set up to not understeer, and with better weight distribution can carry more speeds in to corners. That's great, but I probably won't be there. I used to want an S4 for a track/everyday car [still kinda do] and had one on order but a family tragedy put that on hold for a while. BMW's are the hot thing right now, and for good reason. They got Audi licked on the car to take to the track on the way home. To me Audi is the better car to live with on a daily basis.

5017,"May  9, 2006  5:53PM",gordonwd,"I moved from a '98 A4 1.8T Quattro to a '04 (non-sport)325i, so feel qualified to make a comparison. The 325i, IMO, is superior to the A4 in most every way that counts to me (except for driving in the snow on stock all-season tires). It's not nearly as much contrast as what blueguy says, but we all know that he tends to be somewhat -- shall we say? -- strong in his opinions.   First off, the difference in horsepower was very evident. The 325i is no hotrod at a rated 185 (?), but I think the A4 was only rated at 150, and we all know that BMW's horses tend to be larger than most. The handling on the Bimmer is definitely crisper, and brought an actual ""Wow!"" out of me the first time I took it through some real esses. I had never felt turn-in like that before, since I'd been driving FWD for many years, and Detroit RWD sleds before that.Other than that, the ride and road manners are very comparable, and both are very quiet and comfortable out on the highways. But the A4 could definitely run out of steam in some passing situations on the two-laners. The interior of the A4 was very nice, and it definitely had better climate control logic, but now I'm so used to the 325's cockpit-style dash that I was disappointed in the interior styling of the E90.As for styling, I really think that the A4 peaked out with the model that I owned and that the later revisions and new models have gotten steadily worse. That latest grille is scary and reminds me too much of an Edsel (if any of you out there remember those days). I also think that the 3-series styling peaked out with the facelifted E46 (just coincidentally the model that I happen to own), but styling is always a matter of opinion.So I really don't think that drivers of either brand have cause to throw stones at the other, especially when there are so many other brands more worthy of being thrown at."

And, it is impressive to me that chrysler puts that thumping pushrod v8 in a car (390 lb-ft!) and matches infinti's mpg. Heck, a subaru legacy GT gets 19/25 with it's 2.5T and manual tranny. I'm not too big on bose, but i'd have to hear the systems back to back to judge.  The stereo in my (aging) bmw sucks.  My old saab SE (harmon-kardon) was much better.

Faster, smarter, and safer than what?As far as Saabs, I only said the IS and 3 series earned a top pick as did the Saab. For me, the IIHS top pick means all the cars in that list are safer than other midsize, and I wouldn't pick a Saab over BMW because the rear only got an acceptable vs good. That for the most part would not make a Saab safer overall. It would be the active features, passive features and overall handling, combined with crash test ratings that would make a BMW safer. The BMW would run rings around the Saab, as would the Infiniti. Being able to make an emergency maneuver with confidence is just as important as surviving a crash.In answer to your question, check my profile."

5056,"May 20, 2006 12:41AM",lovemyclk,"The MB is about at the end of it's platform cycle with a new C-Class on the horizen.  New engine series (280/350) has been a major plus.  A fine sedan that has been around to have most kinks worked out.  Interior design getting a bit dated compared to the BMW and Lexus.The Lexus and BMW are brand new platforms and both are appealing in distinct ways.  I must say that the Lexus is designed for humans that are not much over 6'tall up front and ""Hobbit-like"" in the rear.  Rear seat is useful only for your briefcase or groceries... in other words, practically useless.The BMW has a more friendly cabin size-wise and exemplifies the superb BMW driving traits of overall performance balance they are known for.  Everything works in harmony (steering, braking, engine, handling) to deliver a terrific driving experience.  The Lexus is its own interpretation of the BMW experience that may also appeal to you.That said, I'd certainly drive all three under conditions similar to your real-world requirements to develop your own opinion.  Imagine living with each one and using in a manner that best reflects your needs... hauling additional people, kids, cargo, etc.  Beyond that, imagine each of the three sitting in your driveway and determine which one most appeals to you given the right color and option combo.Also, bring a reference CD to test the sound system during your test-drive as well.  I'm sure the total dealer and test-drive experience will help to tilt you in the right direction for you."

You still have to live with whatever you select every day of those 4 years, so select what you really ""want"" to drive.The BMW will not cost you a cent to maintain for 4 years - not for brakes, windshield wiper inserts or oil changes.  Not sure if the RF tires are an option, but BMW did tune the suspension for the firmer sidewall characteristics.The Lexus is just too small, but is a decent design and is a high quality piece.

5063,"May 29, 2006  7:29PM",mikeinmd,"Regarding pricing and value, specifically between Lexus IS and BMW 3 series, here is an example (from a reviewer) worth noting:     ""The IS 350 I drove, with $8,000 worth of Luxury Package, 18-inch wheels, Nav, and Mark Levinson audio, was $44,000. This suggests that Lexus is going toe-to-toe with BMW.    But this isn't really the case, because it doesn't take into account the significantly higher level of content on the IS. Even the base IS 250 with a price of $30,580 has leather, 10-way power seats, keyless access and ignition, a CD changer, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and metallic paint standard. All of these are optional on the BMW 325i. Adding just the leather, keyless system, and metallic paint to the BMW boosts its price, already $1,000 higher than that of the Lexus, to $3,400 higher than that of the Lexus. Adjusting for remaining feature differences boosts that gap even further, to $4,400. The gap is even larger, about $5,000, with the uplevel engines."""
5064,"May 29, 2006 10:02PM",blueguydotcom,"Like I said, I ordered an 06 330i with 6 speed manual, leather, sport package, xenons, power seats/roof, comfort access (keyless ignition/entry) and pdc (park distance control) for less than 36k - MSRP of 41k. The exact car and color I wanted. Now, try going to Lexus and ordering an IS350 with the sport package and xenons.  Best of luck on getting that car.  When I visit the Lexus site it won't even show me a sport package equipped car.  I called dealerships and they all offered to order the car for me - with a deposit and zero info on its delivery time.  Better luck still getting that car in the exact color you want and for less than msrp. You're looking at over 39.7k - assuming a dealer will try to ""order"" (can't really order a Lexus) an IS350 for you that way.  Of course he's gonna demand a deposit, it may take from 4-8 months to get the car and service isn't free (add at least another $1500 for service - brakes, oil changes, tune ups- over 45k miles).So, no the Lexus IS350 isn't in the same ballpark as a 330i as I wanted one.  It wasn't even close.  My 330i  cost considerably less than the IS350 with sport/xenons, which if it ever arrived would have been crippled by an automatic transmission."
5065,"May 30, 2006  2:16AM",habitat1,"With all due respect to those that might shop both the IS350 and 330i and make the decision based upon price, I think you're in the minority.Neither of these cars are inexpensive and the purchase decision is likely to be based upon personal preference, not a couple thousand dollars.  With respect to the IS and 330, at least to me, they are very different in their driving character.   I really don't think these cars are seriously cross shopped as much as this forum might suggest.  Casually cross shopped, maybe.  But if you prefer BMW handling, steering and driving dynamics, it's unlikely that 300 hp stuffed into an automatic sedan with a Lexus suspension is going to get you to switch your preference.  And if you prefer Lexus interior aesthetics and ample electronic do dads, along with exceptional relability,  you're probably not going to switch your preference to a more spartan drivers car.So, my guess is that the price/value debate is more of a friendly joust than a real factor for 90% of buyers.  Lexus could sell the IS350 for $20k and I won't buy an automatic sport sedan.  Not picking on Lexus - I wouldn't even buy the $85k M5 SMG for a similar discount."

You can strap rockets to a soap box and get it to 60 faster than a Ferrari.        BMW's philosophy has always been ""make the sespension faster than the car"".  If you don't buy that ""nonsense"" then GM and Ford have lots of cars just for you.  Has BMW ""fallen"" a couple of notches in power/acceleration?  I don't think so.  Others have tried to make 0-60 the metric of comparison.  BMW makes a 5 passenger M5 that matches my 911S in straight line acceleration and runs circles around anything out of Japan in handling.  The M3 that you ""absolutely love"" will still be a joy to drive for another 20 years, even if it's not the fastest car on the road then, just like a slower Ferrari 328 still is today.  Mashing your foot into the floor of an overpowered, under-suspensioned automatic is a short lived thrill.

Otherwise, we'd be driving elises, or we'd find some way to bring over an ariel atom.For me, what's great about the BMW is the overall balance.  The handling is superb, yet the ride is not very harsh.  Power is good, but the engine is not thrashy and the car still achieves good fuel economy.  The car is roomy inside(you may argue this) yet it maintains a efficient outside package.  The reliability is good.  The interior is quite good.  The resale is strong.IMO( again, just my opinion ) every other car in the category fails on at least one of these points, typically more, and for that reason, i wouldn't consider that car.  The g35 gets bad fuel economy, the engine is thrashy, and it feels just a bit ponderous to me.  The TL has nose-heavy FWD handling.  The CTS has a pretty bad interior.  The a4 is very nose heavy and the back seat is tight.  All IMO and not reasons someone else shouldn't consider that car.

Yet to other people some combination of all of them with regard to priorities as to what is important and what is not.I wasn't comparing an M3 to anything, I was just noting it was part of the 3 series (to some underpowered 3 series) and BMW has all the hp you want, just in a different dollar strata than Lexus. In addition, there was some commentary on the apparent ""slowness"" of the M3. Some of the hp issues will most likely be a non-issue with the arrival of the 335.

Well you have to be very careful with your numbers.  True, ""roadway"" fatalities between the U.S.A. and Germany are nearly identical and have been for some time.  I'm currently looking at 2003 statistics and the U.S.A. actually has a very small edge in that we suffer roughly 9.4 fatalities per one billion kilometers driven versus 9.7 in Germany.  That having been said, those statistics are for ALL roads in the referenced country.  When you limit the statistics to just the ""Motorway"", the U.S.A. suffers 5.2 fatalities per one billion kilometers while Germany slides in at 3.8, a reduction of 27%.Over the years I've read lots of reports from lots of sources and the closest that I've ever heard (from an anti-autobahn group no less) was about 20% fewer fatalities than the U.S. per given distance.

It's just a pleasing package about which there is little or nothing to complain and much to take pleasure in without having to go fast to get it. It's fun just to turn a corner in it.

I have read at least 50 reviews on both these cars and after test driving both cars I have to tell you the majority of reviews are bologny!

My favorite features on this car is the backup camera, tight handling, acceleration, luxury refinements, sporty but smooth ride.  When you open up the ashtray or the sunvisor everything just moves so smoothly.

Handling feel definitely goes to BMW, but the handling on the IS 350 is just as tight also great just with not much feedback.

Dealers usually trade car at port right after they arrived. For my region the port the Jacksonville.2. Request the car before they shipped out. This is not custom-build, instead the dealers request the car right after they rolled out of the assembly line. If dealers don't have special request then it's up to Lexus to distribute the cars.3. Customer-build. This option takes the longest (usually up to 120 days) and yes you can customize your car. The story I heard is that Lexus rarely builds IS with sports package and the only way to get it is through special order.As for the color, like I said the color options Lexus offered is plenty enough for me and also, Lexus doesn't charge extra for paint colors other than while, red and black like BMW does."

The dash was too spartan for me as well.I believe there are 'driving enhusiasts' who want seats that hard.  For me though, a good (not great) performer with comfort is the best mix.  Those making generalizations like 'your opinion is in the minority' one way or the other lose credibility in my view.  If you talk mostly to enthusiasts, the BMW seats are just right and you will feel those of us who like the mixture are in the minority. I see it the other way.  I  have no way of quantifying it and I think others have no way either.

I've been researching and checking the interiors on these cars, meaning the dash layouts, instrumentation, even the styling contours of the seats.  These are my basic likes and dislikes in regard to the the cars that I am eyeing when my lease is up.  Acura TL:  Love the interior looks of this   car all the way from the electric blue   instrumentation, the entire dash layout, and  I think the contour of the front bucket seats  are gorgeous.  Right now, the only thing  I wish the TL had was the auto-headlights and  split fold rear seat.  The current Nissan Maxima:  The fact that my  2002 Maxima has been an excellent car for   four years would probably always keep this  car on my radar.  I know the styling to   many people out there is subjective   inside and out on this car, but I still like   it.    Lexus IS250/350:  It's a beautiful car, but..  It's just too small for my tastes.  BMW 325/330:  While I really like the   exterior styling, especially with the sport  package, i.e., wider tires and such, I really  am not crazy about the interior dash layout/  design.  It's what keeps this car down on the  list for me.  I really feel that the previous  generation 3 series had a much better looking  dash layout/design.  The Infiniti G35/coupe:  Love these cars, but  not crazy about the mpg's with today's gas  prices.  I'd rather get the TL or the Maxima  with a little bit less hp and more mpg's.  Just my two cents!"

For instance, the local ad in town for the  Acura TL for a lease on a non-navi right now  is $354 a month, but they want $4,000 down.  $354 a month might sound nice, but after  reading these forums over the past year,   there's no way I'm putting $4,000 down to  lease a vehicle.  The Infiniti ads are the  same way.  They want ridiculous amounts for  a down payment on a lease.  I get so P.O.'d  when I see this every weekend.  I have to admit, I have hardly seen any  really decent lease offers that anyone has  been getting even on these forums, and I  check the other forums besides Acura.  I'm  always checking out the Lexus forums, the  Infiniti forums (granted some people,  particularly in California, seem to get some  outstanding deals.)

A driver loses the right-of-way when exceeding the speed limit.  If you are speeding, you will be held responsible for any collisions.  This situation is the similar to turning into traffic from a side-street. If the posted speed is 35 MPH you have every right to expect the on-coming traffic is doing 35 MPH or less when calculating your safe-merge zone.If this does not make an sense, think how you would react if you were trying to enter the street from your driveway and the traffic as doing 60 MPH.

They wanted  $4,000 down last week.  I just cannot believe that with all the TLs they've got sitting on the lot, and believe me, they've got PLENTY, the incentives are even worse.  I really don't understand this. As far as Infiniti's lease program, if you go by what's advertised in the Tampa Tribune, the local Infiniti dealer wants too much to be put down for the down payment of a lease, although I have a gut feeling that there's still room for negotiating a decent deal with much less money down.

It seems to me that leases overall are not  very good deals these days as opposed to  four or five years ago.  And you're correct,  I believe the mileage limit for the lease  on the TL is 10k or 12k per year and it's for  a 36-month lease.

For me, that will always be priceless.  When I think about my stupid low lease on my car and how people are paying 550, 600, 650 for a 330i, it almost makes me like the car."

It's important to not make the people who bought 330's just a year ago rue their purchase or to leave BMW with a mass of off-lease cars selling below their residuals.

In fact, the current 06' 330i only came out a little over a year ago. The 335i rumor didn't surface until around March/April this year if my recollection is right.Hmm, don't see how. The Is350 doesn't compare to even a 325i, let alone something like the 335i.Exactly, the IS350 isn't comparable to the underpower 325i, the IS250 is a better candidate, both on price and performance. Oh yeah by the way, just in case you haven't figure out why BMW decided to go with the 335i after only one year into the E90 cycle: the 330i is underpowered comparing to the IS350 and G35. They need a product that's fast enough to make the 3 series a class benchmark again. Although I am not a fan of the current 3's design I'll have to say that BMW did a great job with the 335i. The twin turbo will give it the speed that it was lacking and with BMW's superior handling no doubt the 335i will the ""undisputed"" leader of this segment again.not much of a comparison. The IS350's fast and that's it.I see it as a very good comparison. Here are my predictions of the comparison.Handling: hands down BMWAcceleration: Draw with a slight advantage toward the IS350 (Edmund's first drive clocked the 335i coupe at 5.6 sec from 0-60. However, the sedan version no doubt will be heavier so 5.6 is probably the BEST that it'll be able to do. I predict the 0-60 time for the sedan will be around 5.7, 5.8 sec)Interior/Luxurious: hands down LexusSo again, we are back at the same conclusion as earlier: if you want handling, get a Bimmer; if you want Luxurious, get the Lexus.PS. The 07' IS350 will come with the VDIM off button so it'll be interesting to see how does the comparison play out  due to this factor (It's not like one can't turn off the VDIM before, they just choose to ignore it)."
5243,"July 30, 2006  3:38PM",dewey,335i drawback: No availability of either a  sedan or touring version .A coupe provides lousy space efficinency with little gain in performance/handling. If I want a space inefficient car I will stick with a nimble and light two seater instead.

Not to mention that once the mags (read:C&D) get their hands on the car and apply their proprietary algorithms to determine true 0-60 we'll be all over the map again.Although not in the same price range, the upper end of the 3-series sedans should put to rest any concern on BMW 3 series performance.At 40K+ neither of these cars are entry level."

5246,"July 30, 2006  4:02PM",louiswei,"I think BMW will have a winner in 335i if they are able to manage not to raise the price too much (say less than $1000 from the current 330i). I am also sure that one will be able to find both the IS350 and 330i at below 40k if choose not to get all those high tech toys. Still though, you are right, with any additional options these are easily 40k+ cars. As for C&D, I can't wait to see what kind of ridiculous 0-60 time they'll have for the 335i. My first guess is: 4.9 sec.  :surprise:"
5247,"July 30, 2006  4:11PM",blueguydotcom,"The 335i rumor didn't surface until around March/April this year if my recollection is right.Your recollection is wrong.  Back in June of 05 people were already talking about the turbo engine from BMW.  On bimmerfest the war had already broken out between the 3.5 people and the turbo people.  Everybody knew a bigger 300 HP engine was on the way for 07.   Exactly, the IS350 isn't comparable to the underpower 325i the IS250 is a better candidate, both on price and performance. No, the IS250 is quite simply a joke.  All around sad.  It's slow, expensive, cannot be ordered to specific specs without great trouble and has lousy handling.  The Is350 is the same.  Thus, i wrote exactly what I intended, the IS350 can't even compare to a lowly e90 (or e46) 325i.   They need a product that's fast enough to make the 3 series a class benchmark again. BMW has never been the fastest in their segment.  They don't sell cars based on 0-60 times.Acceleration: Draw with a slight advantage toward the Again, this isn't a BMW thing.  The 325i e90 on a track will devour the IS350 all day long.  No need to be faster off the line if you can take a corner at a much higher rate of speed.Interior/Luxurious: hands down LexusI disagree.  The Lexus interior is too soft and small.  It's plush, coddling and worst of all you can't see anything out of the rear windows.  And you can't order it to specs.   So again, we are back at the same conclusion as earlier: if you want handling, get a Bimmer; if you want Luxurious, get the Lexus.I believe this area is the entry level performance sedans...thus the Lexus fails for many reasons (some already mentioned):Lack of manual - the automanual in the lexus is a piece of steaming dog vomit.  It's extremely slow to react - like all automanuals.  Try a double downshift at 65 mph...the automanual allows it after a several second delay.  Lack of ordering ability.  you cannot order an IS350 as you desire.  Talk to a lexus dealership.  want it with xenons and that's it?  Good luck.  You have to wait and wait and Lexus may never build the car you want.  You simply cannot order the car as you want it.Maintenance - the IS350 will cost money to maintain over a 3 year lease.  Not so the BMW.  BTW, turning off the VDIM won't change the loose handling, vague roadfeel, body rolls and in-general soft design of the buick-like IS350."

A segment leader must contain both the performance and luxury. if this is simply entry peformance sedan segment then we can add cars like Mazda6, EVO, Impreza into discussion.Lack of manualA manual maybe a priority for you but that may not be so important to the majority. We gotta keep in mind that not everyone buys cars in this segment is an ethusiast. Many average Joe (like me) just want a car that's fast enough and feel comfortable driving it. We also don't want a manual since it's very likely we'll be stuck in traffic everyday while going to work and getting home. In fact for me the interior refinement is more important than a manual transmission.Lack of ordering abilityMy suggestion is...go to another dealer because when I bought my IS, my dealer allows special order (you'll just need to wait 3-4 months, that's it). Xenon wasn't a stand-alone option for the 06' MY and that's why you can't just get Xenon by itself. However Lexus has put the Xenon as a stand-alone option for their 07' models.Maintenance - the IS350 will cost money to maintain over a 3 year lease. Not so the BMW.Agree with you here. However, if I am able to afford a 40K car the regular maintenance cost really isn't a priority or anywhere near it in my decision process.BTW, turning off the VDIM won't change the loose handling, vague roadfeel, body rollsHave you try it before?

There were other circumstances - emotional decisions essentially.  I set foot on the lot May 22nd intent on ordering my 330i to spec.  They were busy that day. I went home and thought about the ZHP I saw on the lot.  The next morning I returned and asked if they had another ZHP.  They did: silver gray in the back.  It was untouched, the plastic still encasing the car, cardboard within the interior.  We tore out the plastic and I drove the car.  They told me $400 over invoice.  I did the math on 10 MSDs over the base MF buy rate.  Emotions took over.  I didn't want to wait for the car - I had been driving a Jetta 1.8T that I desperately wanted out of.  The ED deal was attractive and would have meant several thousand dollars in savings over the lease period. But I'd have to hold onto my current Jetta - which was killing me with its awfulness.  I opted to pay more for the car I had driven and took the 330i ZHP that day.  It was purely emotional and not the least bit rational.When my lease was coming up on the 2003 I spent several months test driving the competition again.  Still nobody built a car as nice as my e46 ZHP - including the 06 e90 ZSP. My 03 ZHP was not an option - a myriad of electrical and mechanical problems BMW could not fix.Defeated, I opted to follow-through on the e90 ED lease, opting for a quick two-year lease.   The cost was obscenely low, the car's still more fun than any of its competition (though a shadow of the e46 ZHP's fun) and it gave me a good excuse to go to Europe to see an ex-girlfriend and drive through Europe.   The car's boring but the trip was awesome.Perhaps by 08 BMW will have a decent, fun car available.  If not, maybe the competition will have finely created something fun.  Mazda's Mazdaspeed3 and Infiniti's upcoming 07 G35 look like worthy options for 08.  We'll see."

I do think the e90 has been successful in the marketplace because many of the things that bother you (and would me) go right over the head of a lot of non-enthusiast drivers. Some of them are actually preferred - bigger, quieter, heavier.But I hope BMW doesn't forget that enthusiasts gave BMW much of it's brand equity.  If everyone was happy with 4,000 lb A4 Quatros and 300-hp Buick - I mean Lexus - IS350's, there wouldn't be much need for a BMW brand at all.Some purists even feel Porsche went too far in taking the edge off the beloved 993 model 911 when they introduced the 996.  Fortunately the 997, while being a good daily driver, puts back some of that precision and feel.Good luck in your hunt for a 911.  I don't think Porsche and BMW are mutually exclusive in our house, but it would be tough to justify replacing a sedan (TL) that I'm only driving 25% of the time now."
5285,"August  3, 2006 10:06PM",graphicguy,"But, some of the reasons some of you didn't buy a BMW e-90 are the same reasons I did......--bigger--more refined--perferred the new interior over the old--quieter (at least until you get up in the rev range where it's every bit as smooth....maybe smoother)That's not to say I didn't like the e-46.

I am also pleased with the new refinement and slightly bigger size.  The interior is also a step up, i think, except that is is less driver focused.  I'm not at all a fan of the runflats, and i didn't like HP/torue bias of the non-turbo 3.0L.  The 3.0T fixes the torque issue in a big way, however. dave"

5309,"August  8, 2006  4:09PM",tayl0rd,"blueguydotcom, I'm confused as to why you would even buy a 3-series.  You're complaining that it's too big and too spacious.  Why didn't you opt for a Z28, Trans Am, or Mustang GT?  You would have had a faster car right off the bat, and you could put some stout, reliable aftermarket suspension pieces on to make any one of them perform way better than a 3-series.  And even after changing suspension bits, you'd still be several thousand under the cost of a 3-series. :confuse:  Are you truly a ""driving enthusiast"" or did you just buy into the brand cachet?  Because for the price of the 3-series, there are so many other cars that can do what you claim to prefer so much better for so much less money, i.e. 350Z, S2000, Mustang GT, Z28, Trans Am, (heck, Miata!), WRX STi, EVO IX, et al.  And for the same investment of money, any one of those cars would absolutely annihilate a 3-series on a track, M3 or otherwise. :surprise: Why the BMW?  The interior?  Now you're into pretty much the same reason(s) that other people prefer the newer 3-series, myself included.  I like the bigger size, nicer interior, and smoother lines of the new one.  On a similar note, I've driven a new 330i SP and if that's what you call too smooth and refined, I'd hate to drive one of the older ones. :surprise:   It was noisy, not plush at all, and stiff as a buckboard.  That's fine for my Mustang GT (which isn't noisy at all), but if I'm spending 40 large on a luxury nameplate, there'd better be some luxury in it as well as more size; which is why I'm eyeballing the 550i."

But thats just my opinion. I was considering the IS til I got quote for 31.5k and gettting quotes for the TL under 30k(just cause of the new 1000 incentive...normally 30.5k) and TSX at 25.8k"

Saab 900-all sticks.  But for me, commuting in the Boston area just took all the joy out of a manual (I actually taught the evil wife to drive a stick and bought her the Saab 900 so that I could enjoy it on the weekends, but she too grew tired of rowing her own during her commute and like all women now drives an RX300).  I may indeed return to the manny tranny fold, never say never.  But for now, to me the TL offered the best balance/value of all the attributes important to me, including FWD.  Which, all things being equal (or even not equal?), I have found to be superior in the snow to RWD.  30 years of ski trips to the mountains of New England have proved it over and over to me.Blueguy?

5330,"August  9, 2006  6:59AM",merc1,I think the car you're wanting from BMW is a 130i Sedan or 130i Coupe.  You might get such a car in 2008 when BMW finishes the rollout of the 1-Series bodystyles.  That is about as close to the 1992 3-Series as you're going to get nowadays. M
5331,"August  9, 2006  4:17PM",graphicguy,"tayl0rd.....your (and my previous) Mustang does what it does very well, as we both know.  It does it at an unbelievable price, to boot.However, there is an apples to kumquats difference when comparing a Mustang to a BMW 3 Series.You and I both went through the Mustang GT vs the GTO wars.  What we came away with was there was more to the Mustang than just a few 10ths 0-60 times and using a solid rear axle vs IRS.  All that said, we know what won out in the end.....Mustang continues to sell well and the GTO is now defunct.Like you, I like the bigger size and more refinement & luxury of the 3 Series e90.  Some call it ""blasphemy"" though.  I also it depends on what some would call ""plush"".  While I really like the e90's near ideal balance of lux and performance, there are those that feel BMW ""sold their soul"" in bringing it out, however.  Fact is,you're right.  If someone is spending $35K-$40K for an e90, it better embody lux and refinement elements.As far as your ""stiff ride"" experience with the e90, you may have driven one with the Bridgestone run flat tires.  I purposely bought mine with Continental tires.  The difference in ride/handling is night and day.  From most reports, those Bridgestone runflats are garbage.  They provide a buckboard ride, are noisier than the Continentals and seem to not be a well suited match to the suspension of the e90."
5332,"August  9, 2006  4:48PM",tayl0rd,"Hmmm...Interesting info on the Bridgestones (and they felt like bridge stones, too! :P )  I'll have to give the 330i SP a second drive with different tires and see if I come away with a different opinion.  Hopefully so because it sure is nice."
5333,"August  9, 2006  9:21PM",graphicguy,"tayl0rd....I orginally drove a 3 series with the bridgestone run flats.  I remember telling the sales guy after hitting a very moderate pot hole....""I think this thing's got a busted shock"".  Of course, it didn't, but those tires really punish on anything other than relatively smooth pavement.  They were loud on concrete, too.  The 2nd test drive, at a different dealer, felt like a different car. Firm, yet supple, ride.  It would shoot through the twisties almost telepathically and at speeds I wouldn't dare run in most other cars.Finished the test drive and looked at the tires....sure enough they were different....they were the continentals.I didn't buy the one I test drove, but told the sales person from the 2nd test drive that in order to make a sale, he'd have to find one for me that had the Continentals.  Fortunately, I think the ones produced later in the year came with Continentals since he had more '06 330is with continentals than he did with Bridgestones.Mine had only 10 miles on it when I bought it so it was probably produced later in the model year."
5334,"August  9, 2006  9:53PM",sowku,yup. IS sucks.
5335,"August 10, 2006 12:53AM",jzalkin,"""yup. IS sucks.""Wow - that is what I call an intelligent argument.  Lexus has done a great job at providing Luxury that has surpassed the others and now has provided sport in the IS to go with it. I would have not looked at any Lexus until the IS.BTW (side rant) - look at how many manuals actually are sold and then tell me that it really makes a difference in the marketplace to a car company.  I think the car makers just have them for the image.  People who post are more passionate, but make a small portion of buyers (inconsequential to a mass builder).  As found in edmunds ""Somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of the Ferrari F430s that come to America have the ""F1-inspired"" electronically triggered and hydraulically actuated transmission installed. Every Mercedes SLR McLaren comes with a five-speed automatic. Where the high end goes, the rest of the industry eventually follows. And the way this is going, the clutch pedal is doomed"" I love it when a poster says the BMW is too big and should be lighter, only include a manual, and have no special electronics.  BMW is not making cars for you!  They are making it for the professional that likes the image and wants a bigger, safer car with bells and whistles.  So you know where I am coming from I sold an A4 for an IS.  I loved the Audi and the Lexus is exceeding my expectations.  The Lexus is more luxurious, and feels more sporty at times.  The Audi was a great execution of simplicity and just did what it needed to do well.  Preference - I don't have one yet, but the Lexus is exceeding the hype for me.  For those that think of Lexus as just a Toyota (or Infiniti is just a Nissan) - stop being a snob.  Is a Lamborghini just a VW/Audi?  Cars should be (many other examples) judged on their own merits.End of Rant."
5336,"August 10, 2006  1:48AM",louiswei,"I would have not looked at any Lexus until the IS. Man I couldn't say it better. I always thought Lexus was for old people and it has no character and totally lacks styles...until the IS came along. I was so impressed I made it the first car I bought by myself. So far I am very satisfy with it and it definitely does NOT suck.Also, I totally agree with you on the manual tranny. Lexus estimated they'll sale 70% IS250 and 30% IS350 (so far they're right on target) and about 25% of the 3 series sold were manual. By using those numbers, if Lexus puts manual on the 350 that'll consist about 7.5% of the total IS sale numbers. To Lexus that number is really not that significant and they might figure it's better not to produce manual 350 in order to cut production cost.However, I do believe that if Lexus really want to be a serious player in the performance sedan field they'll have to put manual tranny on their cars in order to shut those people up. Even of it's only availabe through special order."
5337,"August 10, 2006 11:21AM",louiswei,"I think IS350 is going to get a manual tranny sooner or later (maybe during the mid-life upgrade in 08'?). As for the backseat I'd agree with you, it is too small. However, I think Lexus purposely made the backseat of the IS smaller so it won't hurt ES's sales.One needs to realize that Lexus currently has two entry level sedans in IS and ES unlike the other brands. Since they know the ES will sell well no matter what as long as they put enough goodies in there. Thus, they have the luxury to experiment with the IS. One thing that puzzles me, I wonder what's Lexus' intended demography for the IS?"
5338,"August 10, 2006 11:42AM",kdshapiro,"""One needs to realize that Lexus currently has two entry level sedans in IS and ES""Yes and no, mostly no. The ES 350 starts at 33K msrp. The IS 250 starts at 31K MSRP. So for almost the same price you get one car with a 3.5 liter engine and one car with a 2.5 liter engine. The IS350 is significantly more expensive. They are not the same cars (furthering the thought the ES 350 is a rebadged CAMRY). Most car manufacturers have some overlap with the price in their product lines as well.In reality the ES350 is a top of the line CAMRY, while the IS250 is a bottom of the line IS."
5339,"August 10, 2006 12:14PM",louiswei,"The IS350 is significantly more expensiveNot really.Top of the line ES350: $44,774.00Top of the line IS350: $41,139.00IS350 has a higher MSRP than the ES but once you added all the goodies (most ES's do) the ES is priced higher than the IS350.From this we can see Lexus' strategy to have 2 entry level sedans in their lineup. ES will attract buyers whom have families and are looking for a comfortable and luxurious ride (there are a lot of them out there, in fact, more than the so called enthusiasts). IS is aiming for...I don't know, semi-enthusiasts (or so called poseur by some of you)?"
5340,"August 10, 2006 12:28PM",merc1,An ES350 can run 44K?  Yikes!M
5341,"August 10, 2006  1:24PM",kdshapiro,"""The IS350 is significantly more expensive""You're playing the option game. The IS350 is $5K more msrp, starting at $36K, than the 250. From what you post it is obvious that Lexus let's you option out the ES350 more heavily than the IS350.ES350 - $11K in options.IS350 - $5K in options.The IS350 is $3K more expensive then ES350 according to Lexus website.So that even furthers my contention the ES350 is a top of the line CAMRY. It is true Lexus does have 3 models of cars and two platforms within $5K base price of one another, but there is no mistaking the rear seat of an IS with the rear seat of an ES. It's like saying the MiniCooper and 325 are two entry level sedans within BMWs lineup.That's about the difference between the ES and IS."
5342,"August 10, 2006  1:38PM",louiswei,"Please read my post before replying some random stuff...According to the Lexus website, a TOP OF THE LINE ES is more expensive than the IS. All what I was trying to say is Lexus has 2 entry level sedans aiming at different market demographic. THAT'S IT. Why you think Lexus let you option out the ES more heavily? Because they are aiming at the customers whom are looking for more luxury.At least the ES and IS belong to the same segment (entry lux), the MINI and your beloved 3er are not (not even close). 3er: entry luxMINI: subcompact?but there is no mistaking the rear seat of an IS with the rear seat of an ESDidn't you read my previous post?"

I agree that the IS is not for you, but I would argue that Lexus and many other manufactures are willing to give up those sales.  Lexus can do it - they choose not to.  It makes their cars better for some and worst for others.  Clearly the IS is not for people who carry 4 people often.  It is for people that prefer coupes, but want/need the benefit of a sedan.  I rarely have anyone in the back seat (one every few months), but it is nice to have it as extra storage.  The rear doors help with utilizing the space for many reasons.  Think of it as a roomier execution of the RX-8 concept.  If one needs a full family car - then Lexus offers the ES and GS.  I have had multiple people in my back seat as everyone wants a ride in the new car so the backseat is just fine for lunch trips, etc.  I think people make too big a deal about the size unless they need a full size sedan. A lot of single or married (no/small kids) professionals that do not need a roomey back seat.  Why would Lexus make the 350 have a manual?  Retool and add the extra cost for maybe 5% more sales.  Does that make economic sense?  Time will tell if Lexus has judged the market correctly.  If they have solid (does not have to be industry best) sales then they have targeted correctly.  Early results are positive.  Keep in mind, car makers are in business to sell cars - not satisfy a minority of posters. That is why the IS250 automatic will be the best seller in the lineup.  I believe as stated in a previous post (reinforced by Edmunds article) that manuals are a dying breed.  I had several through the years and have no desire to use a clutch ever again.The great thing is that there are a lot of good choices.  If manual and a large engine is your thing then you can have a great car.  Lexus will not mourn loosing you.  I also believe (don't have the statistics) that automatics have a better resale since they are more desirable.  Same as having leather.Enjoy whatever car you choose."
5344,"August 10, 2006  2:52PM",shipo,"One of the many problems that I have with the IS is that it was originally touted by Lexus management as their answer to the 3-Series.

Well, under the old adage of ""Cover your competition"", Lexus is the ONLY maker of small Lux/Sport sedans that doesn't offer a manual gearbox with their larger engine.As far as Automatics having better resale than Manuals, well, I suppose that depends upon the car.  My 2002 530i 5-Speed, PP & SP was resold (after lease end) for a higher price and quicker than any of the comparable 530i Automatics on my BMW dealer's lot.

All the big talk from Lexus about how it's got the 3 series in it's sights and so on and so forth, and then to come out with a car that is unable to turn off traction control, and not have a stick, well the joke is on Lexus since they clearly know nothing about the soul of a ""drivers car"" which is why they targeted BMW in the first place. Nobody is calling Infiniti a joke, they for the most part get it. Audi for sure get's it IMO. Lexus does not. Kind of funny [see joke] IMO.   Now the Lexus is a looker, and they are obviously classy cars. But no competition. It almost can't be considered sport IMO. The Audi has no back seat either, but they get the sport thing. If Lexus brought the driving dynamics, and the stick nobody would be saying a thing about the friggen back seat.....End of rant, good night now"
5372,"August 10, 2006  6:44PM",blueguydotcom,"1) Is the Lexus IS large enough to be USED as a sedan on a regular basis?No.  I'm only 145 lbs and five-seven and I can't fit comfortably in the backseat of the IS350 with the front seat in my normal driving position (which is closer to the wheel than most as performance driving instructors suggest a position that's far less relaxed than most people use).2) Does a small sedan qualify for the ""Performance"" moniker if it only offers a manual transmission on its most anemic engine?No.  I wanted the IS350 as a replacement for my BMW ZHP.  I was frothing at the mouth when they announced the car.  Finally, someone would tackle BMW and I could get away from a brand I loathe. No manual = supreme boredom.  A bad automanual - like the IS350's - makes driving not just boring but annoying.  The double and triple downshift lag is unforgivable.3) Based upon the pre-release Lexus marketing hype along with the pre-release rhetoric from Lexus management about the IS being a true 3-Series competitor, ""Has the IS lived up to its pre-release billing or is it something of a joke?""Doesn't even come close to what Lexus promised in 2005 at the NYIAS.  The Lexus execs lied.  They claimed the IS would lead not only in luxury but performance.  They claimed the car was designed to be the best-in-class in all categories.  They lied.  The handling, the tranny and the interior space don't even come close to the G35 or 3 series.  The pricing structure and packaging makes the car ludicrously difficult to purchase with a sport package and xenon lights.  My drives in the IS350 left me deliriously unhappy.  Failing in every way - save for wizzbang gadgets - all the criteria important to me were left out of the IS: driving involvement, roadfeel, handling, packaging, etc.  Lexus lied."
5373,"August 10, 2006  6:44PM",louiswei,"Dear god, you don't read too well do you? Let me post it again:Did I say ES350 belongs in this discussion? Not that I recalled. I was stating Lexus has two entry luxury sedans (note: no performance) that are aiming for different market demographic. That's all.Okay, so Lexus doesn't have 2 entry level sedans. One is entry level performance and what's the other one? :confuse:"

Case closed.Not with sport package.  The manual G35 comes with the sport suspension standard.  Ditto xenons.To get an IS350 with sport and xenons you're looking at nearly 40k.Say a 5k difference.  Does that make you happy? Kinda funny the 4 year old G35 outperforms Lexus' brand new IS350.  Relentless pursuit of perfection?  Hardly. Let's stay tuned to see if the new G35 will be going out the door for about 30 grand like you said this coming November. I would be shocked to see the base G35 manual go for more than 34k.

Sure it was only $600 below MSRP but that's still a discount.This reminds me of the yahoos saying the BMW 335i won't sell below MSRP yet we've already seen people getting them for $1250 over invoice at Bimmerfest.  Shop around...just because one dealer says MSRP, another will see a sale.Just watch, I estimate Infiniti will price the G35 at $34.5K MSRP.

5389,"August 11, 2006 12:29AM",jzalkin,"1) Is the Lexus IS large enough to be USED as a sedan on a regular basis? Yes.  Most of these cars suck if you have 4 full size adults that need to use the seat often.  For me the IS works fine.  Just had two coworkers in there today - no complaints.  One couldn't shut up about how great the car is.2) Does a small sedan qualify for the ""Performance"" moniker if it only offers a manual transmission on its most anemic engine? Yes, in my book since I would not buy a manual.  Fast is fast however it gets there.  My A4 had zero gears (CVT) and I would say that it was a performance sedan.  It comes in a manual, but why would I care since I would not by one.  Is the SLR not a sports car?  It only comes in an automatic.  3) Based upon the pre-release Lexus marketing hype along with the pre-release rhetoric from Lexus management about the IS being a true 3-Series competitor, ""Has the IS lived up to its pre-release billing or is it something of a joke?"" I came down to the BMW and Lexus and chose the Lexus.  Others have crossed shoped so - yes it is."
5390,"August 11, 2006 12:55AM",jzalkin,"Here it is.  I will call you out as an idiot and you will be ridiculed by all if you argue against the basic points.Point 1:  All of these cars (3 series, IS, G35, C Class, CTS, TL) belong in this group.  Some are newer and some are getting long in the tooth, but they all are competition. If a lot off people cross shop a model then it IS competition.  If only a few then it is not.  I bet almost everyone looked at a few of these model before selecting their car.Point 2:  Different is good.  It leads to choices and ability to get the best fit for them.  Some difference help and some hurt.  Sales will determine if a model is a success.  Point 3:  Just because YOU want a feature - does not make it the end all be all definition.  Just because you think a car should have a manual does not mean everyone else does.  Just because the TL is not RWD, does not mean it does not belong.  Get over yourself - you are not the resident expert.  You are just like the rest of us posting nothing more than your OPINION.  If you will only drive a manual then I guess that matters to YOU.  Since the vast majority of people (BMW buyers included) do not drive a manual - that is not a criteria for selection.  I could not see anyone saying ""I want an automatic, but I won't look at the IS since the 350 does not offer a manual.""  Does anyone else see the absurdity of this argument?Point 4:  Berating others is childish just makes you look like and idiot.  Enough said.Point 5:  No one car is the overall best.  One may be best given certain criteria, but another criteria will put another car on top.  -----------I picked the IS for me.  Came down to the BMW and I just didn't like it as much.  I had the A4 and just didn't love the BMW with i-drive (Nav) in it."
5391,"August 11, 2006  1:06AM",louiswei,"Couldn't say it better myself.  I too picked the IS over the 3er. Was also considering the TL (die hard Acura fan here), however, it is just too big for my taste. Love the handling of the 3er but its ugly interior and IS's superior engine ultimately made me choose the IS over it."
5392,"August 11, 2006  1:46AM",primetime79,"1) Is the Lexus IS large enough to be USED as a sedan on a regular basis? Absolutely.  I am 6 feet tall.  I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old.  About two or three times a week I hva ethem in my car and they fit fine. We atually went on a 3hr roadtrip and we perefectly fine.  And actually last night at a party me and my coworker picked up two blondes who were about 5 6"" 5 7"" and they fitted fine no complaints. Actually they sweated all aspects of the car from the navitgation, to the bluetooth, handsfree keyless entry, push button start.  elegant interior, interior lighting, sound system.2) Does a small sedan qualify for the ""Performance"" moniker if it only offers a manual transmission on its most anemic engine? I initially was adamant about getting a manual and was quite disappointed when I found out the IS will only be offered in auto.  But, the auto in the IS is quick.  Some people(blueguydot.com constantly post the shifting is slow in the IS.  I disagree, I find it very nimble and if you read most reviews, reviewers agree.  3) Based upon the pre-release Lexus marketing hype along with the pre-release rhetoric from Lexus management about the IS being a true 3-Series competitor, ""Has the IS lived up to its pre-release billing or is it something of a joke?""

I'm not qualified to anser this question because I've never sat in the back of a new generation IS. 2) Does a small sedan qualify for the ""Performance"" moniker if it only offers a manual transmission on its most anemic engine?Toyota/Lexus has A LOT more money then BMW does.  Even if a manual IS350 was to only make up a small percentage of sales, they could make a business case for it.  An IS350 with a stick (and no doubt a MUCH sportier suspension) would get a lot of good press.   3) Based upon the pre-release Lexus marketing hype along with the pre-release rhetoric from Lexus management about the IS being a true 3-Series competitor, ""Has the IS lived up to its pre-release billing or is it something of a joke?""NO, it has not lived up to its marketing hype.  Lexus really got me excited about this car.  There are some BMW drivers out there who are dissatisfied with their 3ers for one reason or another whether it be a horrible service department, electrical problems... (on the flip side there are MANY who are extremely pleased with not only how their cars drive, but how well they run).  Lexus has an impeccable reputation for customer service & quality.  If they could take a small percentage of BMW owners away from their stick shift, sports package equipped 3ers they'd build on a performance reputation that will only help them grow more.  How about people moving up from 6 speed, V6 Honda Accords who are ""afraid"" of buying a German car?  There is definitely a market for an IS350 manual w/ sportier suspension.I'll admit that acceleration was blistering when I drove the 300+ horsepower IS350 at a LEXUS driving event.  The suspension was sloppy & floaty, the steering felt way too light and disconnected to the road.  The brakes were touchy & artificial feeling.  The lack of a manual tranmission made it even harder to swallow.  The 330iA (255hp version) equipped with Sports Package & Slushbox felt much more alive in my hands.  I jumped in and it felt like the car was my own.  YOu definitely felt the power deficit of the BMW.  The steering was spot on.  Handling was neutral.  The BMW felt light on its feet.  The brakes were strong and easy to modulate."

When shopping, I also wandered over to the Audi store since they were offering A6Q's for $9K off MSRP.  I liked the Audi interior the best.  Their reputation for making the best interiors in the Premium end is well-deserved.I always do the ""knuckle wrap"" test on interior surfaces.  No matter where I tapped in the 3 Series, it was clear BMW used high quality, well put together parts.  The whole car, from the doors to the dash, had a ""bank vault-like"" feel.  Plus, the wood was more abundant and better looking in the 3 Series than in the IS (whose wood looked like plastic, IMHO).Didn't get that same result with the IS on the knuckle wrap test.Don't get me wrong, I thought the Lexus interior was nice.  The BMW had more of an understated elegance to it in comparison, though (as did the Audi).  But, that's not the real reason we buy BMWs....it's the drive, ride, performance of the cars that gets us.Breifly looked at the CTS...not bad, but I always qualified it with the adder...NOT BAD FOR GM.  There was still a lot of large expanses of plastic.  And the knuckle test didn't do much to float my boat, either."
5428,"August 15, 2006  2:16PM",kdshapiro,"I think we have the same general opinion. When I test drove the top end CTS (not the V), I thought Caddy did a great job on the interior, ok ride and ok exterior.The interior was soothing. Which after the drive led me to the following observation about interiors and interior color: Understated interior look best in dark colors, while overstated interiors look best in lighter colors."
5429,"August 15, 2006  2:26PM",habitat1,"Well, IMO I think the only people qualified to say that driving a SMG/DSG Porsche, AMG, M and (especially) Ferrari isn't serious sport are:  1. Race car drivers 2. Fighter pilots 3. Astronauts  I wonder which group does habitat1 belong to?None of the above.  But I do have a functioning left foot and right hand, and prefer using both in a sports sedan or sports car.  Note, I did not say a million dollar Formula One race car.  Which is capable of 4+ G's in flat out tight turns and, as such, places a premium on having both hands on the wheel.  I'm pretty sure that most race car drivers would prefer an SMG at Monaco rather than having to do multiple sets of 100 lb arm curls like they used to in the 70's.  But from the SMG/DSG cars I've driven, that don't require forearms like Arnold to control, I find SMG/DSG's to take away too much from the direct control and fun to drive experience.     For the record, I had my opinion in 1978 when I bought my first new car (a $4,000 Datsun B210 GX 4-speed).  And when we bought our 1995 Nissan Maxima SE 5-speed (which we still own with 155k miles).  So the fact that I am now fortunate enough to own a 911 didn't change either my opinion on manual transmssions or of my own intelligence.  I'm just as dumb and stubborn now as I've always been.   For the posters here defending a right to have an opinion, thanks.  And louiswei, that right applies to you, too."
5430,"August 15, 2006  2:40PM",habitat1,"In my opinion, you can have a stick without sport, but you can't have (serious) sport without a stick. And that opinion does take into acount the best that Audi, Porsche, AMG, BMW-M and even Ferrari currently have to offer in SMG's and DSG's.:mad:  MSorry.

5433,"August 15, 2006  6:17PM",alp8,"I can't quite understand the comments about too much plasticEvery car is loaded with plastic.What is it that makes someone get into a Caddy and say ""plastic"" but keeps that person from saying ""plastic"" when they get into an Audi?  I doubt there is more plastic in the Caddy. But maybe we really can detect ""more"" even if that more is only 1% more.  I know the human eye is more precise than we think it is.Let's see side by side comparo pics of the interiors and then let's judge.  I wonder if the criticism is born out of the shape of things, rather than the feel of things.   Just curious, not being criticial of anyone's opinions here."
5434,"August 15, 2006  6:46PM",louiswei,"Side by side pictures comparo won't do any good...First off let me say that I totally agree with you 100% on every car in this segment are loaded with plastic. However, 2 very important factors determined if the interior feels ""plastic-ish"" or not:1. Percentage of hard-plastic used.2. Quality of the plastic used.If the interior used too much hard-plastic, it might looks good but once you touched it, it'll feel cheap. Same thing goes to lower-grade quality plastic. The Caddy probably didn't use more plastic than Audi but it definitely used more hard-plastic and the quality are lower grade."
5435,"August 15, 2006 10:19PM",jordanrobinson,"Getting back to the topic I thought I was posting in, what do you guys consider Entry-Level?  And what qualifies as performance?  For instance would a Ford Fusion (V6) be considered performance?  Granted it doesn't have a manual available, but the 6-speed Auto does a decent job.  The 4-cyl has the manual but even being a good size 4 it doesn't offset the weight well enough.  So I guess my questions are (being new to the forums and this discussion) is there some kind fo standard that has to be met to be considered entry-level and ""performance"" sedan?  (Other then the obvious.)  Some people would argue that a 4-door Civic can perform.  But I would disagree. A lot. Thanks!"
5436,"August 15, 2006 10:32PM",pat,"It's not just ""entry-level"" and ""performance"", but also ""luxury"".  Neither the Fusion nor the Civic fit in that last category.  You might want to check out the Midsize Sedans Comparison Thread for comparison conversations involving the Fusion and the Economy Sedans (~$16k-$20k) where the Corolla is included - admittedly at the top of that scale.Check out the top of the discussion - that's where you will find the topic focus.  Other vehicles may come and go, but the ones listed at the top usually form the core of the conversations.By the way, welcome to CarSpace!

5437,"August 15, 2006 11:23PM",jordanrobinson,"Thanks Pat!!  Since we're on the topic and it seems to fit better here, have any of you driven a new Lincoln Zephyr?  Before I'm kicked out of the thread hear me out (and this is not a product advertisement, my dealership only does Ford/Mercury, no Lincoln.. yet..)  Anyway, I recently drove a Zephyr after being told it was a lot like a Fusion.  They were very wrong.  Not only is the V-6 tuned to be MUCH beefier, but the suspension is very different and the amenities make much more of a luxury vehicle. (I checked the first post and I believe all the requirements for the thread are here!)  Now, I realize compared to a lot of what you folks are referring to (BMW, Audi, etc) the Zephyr is underrated and outclassed to some extent.  But it also stickers for right around $30k with a lot of style and luxury options such as leather, 3 stage heated and cooled seats, etc.  It certainly impressed me more then the CTS I drove.  Any opinions/experiences?"
5438,"August 16, 2006 12:38AM",louiswei,"IMO, I think Zephyr barely fits the entry-level luxury category but definitely not the ""performance"" and that's from a so-called poseur like me (because I drive an automatic). Many hardcored enthusiasts in this board will tell you that in order to be a ""real"" performance sedan one needs to:1. Have a manual tranny2. Be a RWD or AWDUnfortunately Zephyr has neither of those.Also, as many cars under this segment are pushing 300+ HP, Zephyr with 221 HP is definitely underpowered. Just like many said before that the ES350 (which is NOT in this category) is a dressed up Camry I think Zephyr is just a dressed up Fusion as well.Those are just my opinions (educated or not)."
5439,"August 16, 2006  1:01AM",jordanrobinson,"All wheel drive is coming in the 2007 model (at least for the Fusion, so I assume the Zephyr will have it also) but you got me on the manual gearbox.  A 6-speed manual would definetly score some points. (even though I also concede it would not make up for the 80 or so HP that it lacks as well.)  Maybe Ford will develop a SVT Fusion.  It could throw all the amenities the Zephyr offers in with a Mustang V-8, AWD, and a six speed manual.  I'll let you know when they announce it.   In the meantime thanks for humoring me!"
5440,"August 16, 2006  1:04AM",louiswei,"Even if Ford comes out with the SVT Fusion, it still won't be an ""entry luxury performance sedan"". It'll be a worthy competitor to Mazdaspeed 6 and Subaru Legacy though."
5441,"August 16, 2006  1:07AM",cdnpinhead,"Well, color me surprised.  I actually agree.What I'm searching for is a RWD vehicle with a manual.  It needs to hold my bicycle inside (fold-down rear seats &/or wagon/avant).Turns out the RWD thing gets you the luxury bit.  If there were still such a thing as an RWD vehicle that wasn't a BMW, Infiniti, Cadillac, Mercedes or Lexus, I'd be interested.  Am I missing something obvious?Recently I've decided that a proper European turbo-diesel (something I learned to love ~5 years ago) might trump one or more of my other ""requirements,"" as in VW or Audi.  No such luck.  Unless I can stomach a VW Jetta (& not the wagon), I'm SOL.The search goes on.  It's looking more and more like a gas 328."

At 12,000 miles per year, the G35 requires more 43 gallons, or $130 more per year.

People care more about the gas prices than they used to and a lot do not want/need the fastest engine in these cars.  BMW/Lexus has an option to get the style, luxury, etc and the higher gas mileage.  Infiniti does not. I eliminated the old G35 on that basis and chose between the Lexus IS 250 and BMW 325.

I am not going to argue about the speed, but since most of these models are sold with the smaller engine, the masses have said that speed is not the major buying decision (my A4 had 187hp and weighed almost 4,000 pounds). BTW - I love how BMW fans use a marketing slogan to talk about cars.  The Ultimate Driving Machine is an advertising slogan and not a true assessment of a car.  Anyway - the BMW is a good car.  The Lexus is a good car.  The Infiniti will be a good car.  All have their strengths and weaknesses.  It depends on the individual buyer to determine which appeals to them.  To dismiss the Lexus in the marketplace is just plain naive.If sales remain solid and they add the IS500, coupe, and convertible then the IS will have enough models to compete with the whole line of BMW.

5529,"September  6, 2006  4:37PM",kernick,"Well my definition of a manual is a transmission with a clutch-pedal.  Anything else regardless of whether it has a clutch a rubber-belt (CVT), DSG, a torque converter or whatever is an automatic.  They are just different variations of automatic operation.  IMO, an automatic transmission is one that you don't have to intervene with, unless you want to. In general: If a person can do anything better than a machine, it is simply a matter of time until that machine is evolved (designed) to be better.  A person may enjoy shifting a manual and controlling the car in general, but more and more functions of a car can be better handled by the machine.On the cars being discussed here, I think either transmission is acceptable.  I wouldn't worry about 0.2 sec difference or whatever in ""optimum launch"" acceleration, when this class of vehicle is not optimized for speed anyway.  The cars being discussed here are too big, too heavy, and too small of displacement (at least without forced induction) to really quibble about their performance.I'd take the '07 G35X as the pick of the class for having adequate power combined with all-weather AWD, at a decent price."

While an automatic is not your cup of tea, the 4.9 0 to 60 that C&D got with the 335i, combined with probably above average gas mileage, makes the auto 335i a compelling package you have to admit."

5532,"September  7, 2006  1:00AM",robertr,Agree with your definition of what an automatic is.  I  dislike automatics (=anything without a clutch) for a number of reasons. One in particular is I like to control how and when my car shifts.  I hate it when you want to accelerate suddenly with an automatic - you floor the gas - then there is a delay - then it downshifts with a big jerk - then it finally goes with more power than you want but too late when you could have finessed it with an anticipatory double-clutched smooth downshift to the proper gear with smooth throttle application in a manual. A skillfully driven stick is still much smoother and more controlled than an automatic in all driving conditions despite automatics having gotten much better in recent years.  The 2007 G35 automatic rev-matching feature on downshifts is the latest interesting improvement - I wonder if it will eliminate the jerk on the downshift that I experience everytime I get a loaner when my car is in for service.  Nevertheless it will be a long long time before I want to give up the fun and satisfaction of driving a true manual.

Growing up my friends' parents would track their Porsches, BMWs, etc.  What better way is there to learn about the limits of your car than by really testing them?

5537,"September  7, 2006  4:54PM",mz6greyghost,"... it's about having more control of your car.  Manuals offer that, automatics don't, plain and simple.  I'd much rather drive anything with a stick, be it a G35 or a Lotus Elise.  I'd rather use a clutch, and my own choice of gear, to navigate a slippery snow-covered road, or to blast down a twisty two-lane, keeping the engine at it's optimum RPMs, to use engine braking instead of burning through brake pads, and to be able to pass someone in no time, not having to wait for the tranny to pick the right gear.I may be part of a dying breed, but I don't care.  If an automaker wants my business, then they have to offer a manual, and NOT just to their lower-level cars.  That's why I'll never consider a Lexus, having the IS350 without a stick is heresy, and IMO, that's why they'll never get the praise (and $$$$) of a true enthusiast."

5539,"September  8, 2006 12:41AM",kernick,"My point about these cars being discussed was that it was in this class of vehicles it is not that relevant to worry about the performance.  These cars are too big, too heavy, and too small of displacement to ever really be near the tops in any performance categories.  Whether a car can accelerate to 60mph in 5.5 or 5.8 or 6.0 sec really is not a significant difference.  Or whether under optimal conditions you can get 5.5 sec with the manual, while you can get 5.8 sec. consistently with the auto.  The same with many of the other performance categories of these cars.  They are slight differences.To some it up in a few words I'd say if you want a performance car you shouldn't be buying any of these vehicles.  These are ""sporty"" vehicles.The reason I pick the G35X is because I think AWD is a significant performance advantage for many in many types of weather.  And I know BMW has AWD but I believe they will be significantly more $, and are down in power to the Infiniti.  But neither is a Vette, Shelby-car, SRT-car, or Elise.  These entry-level luxury cars have serious compromises to provide comfort for 4, provide luxury features, keep mpg decent, while keeping the price reasonable."

There were an abundance of Autos and a few SMGs.One final comment - one positive thing for automatics is that if you are the driver of a group of friends, an auto might be better in that if you are too tired to drive, a friend can drive your car back, while the same may not be the case of a manual.

No they arent lexus or acura but they are better then Mercedes, Cadillac, lincoln, Audi, and as good as infinity.  Also maintance is rolled into the price premium.  As far as the turbos go, yes this is new technology (just not on trucks).  Go to NASIOC and see how many STI owners would like a variable vane turbo rather then there VF39's.  It eliminates turbo lag.  BMW was not trying to beat all comers on horsepower.  They already did that with the last 3.2liter M3 (as far as 6cyl are concerned).  They wanted better fule economy and a huge flat torque curve.  O and a WRX STI does not have 430lb-ft in stock form.  Not even close.  My other ride is a 02WRX with stage 3 mods (vf30 turbo and larger IC).  It has been fun and reliable but I have no gurentee it will be tomorrow, the BMW with less HP is what I choose to drive most of the time.  Its just more comfortable and I dont have to shift (yes I am lazy), it also handels as well.  Next car will be the next M3.

However, I did notice a different feel to the regular steering in the 335i. For one thing, it seemed to have a more direct, tighter steering ratio than any other BMW I have ever driven. It steers like a sports car, not a sedan, and I found it very sensitive to road feedback. Observe this closely when you test drive it. I look forward to what you have to say about it."

It delivered great acceleration in every gear I tested. Shifting gears with a stick was the smoothest of smooth experiences.You are correct the steering was definitely superior to a 330i sedan that I had also tested today.The car handled the few sharp bends and curves I took quite flawlessly. Rear space was more than I had expected. The interior's fit and finish quality seemed superior to the sedan. Everything about this car seemed superior to the sedan, especially the styling. I love the styling so much that I just may get a coupe instead of the sedan. The coupe looks a bit like the 1980's 6 series and definitely looks more expensive than the sedan.  Unfortunately  a sedan is more suitable to my family needs. So right now my decision to purchase the 335 is dependent on one unresolved matter: chooing between the coupe or the sedan?"

5589,"September 12, 2006 12:41AM",texasmerq,"The Lancer Evo uses a very large turbo and to get the impressive acceleration numbers you have to keep the revs pretty high (3K-5K.) It is a very fun car to drive, especially on back roads with no traffic or police. That said in real world day to day for the average driver the 335i is probably faster as the torque comes in very early (1400-1800 RPM) and stays around past the normal shifting range in day to day driving (5K RPM.)I drove the 335i coupe this weekend but they only had automatics. They did shift extremely smoothly and quickly though. It was much better than I expected out of an automatic. I do prefer the rear view of the coupe, but I think I will wait on the 335i sedan personally because I prefer the overall styling of it more. To reiterate the steering did feel tighter which isn't necessarily a bad thing.I emailed an associate of mine who works for BMW in Germany and she said 335i sedans should become availible stateside beginning in Otober and should be saturated in most markets by late November. It has been availible there since mid-June I believe. If your dealer said it wasn't coming then they obviously just wanted to move units on the lot.

One could also get about the same performance numbers out of a Ford Mustang GT for under $30K but again it's not really in this class either. You need different tools for different jobs. Regarding power v. displacement. While it's true that the EVO has a 2.0l and the WRX STi has a 2.5l engine they use much larger turbos and a higher boost as well. That's why there is more perceivable turbo lag in those applications. That's not to say they are bad but the 335i engine still feels like it's naturally aspirated for all intents and purposes.

When Lexus took on Mercedes in the luxury segment, they did a good job.  Their approach in the sport sedan segment, with the IS and GS, leaves a lot to be desired, IMO.  And it's not just the manual transmission, although that's an obvious omission.  Drive a 5 series back to back with a GS and if you can't tell a big difference in driving dynamics, you need your butt-meter recalibrated.

5630,"September 20, 2006 11:09AM",louiswei,"The bottom line is: Lexus is not out there to satisfy the so-called enthusiast. They are simply out there selling cars no matter how you going to spin it. The sales number for the IS is around 5000-6000 units per month and compare to 3er's 10K+ I think so far the IS is doing a pretty good job sales-wise. The Rome is not built in one day, so does not the 3er nor the IS. It took BMW many decades to establish the 3er as the benchmark and it's likely that it'll take some time for others to knock it off (if they ever will).One thing that frustrated me the most is that many Lexus owners can understand why others went for the 3er (pure driving dynamics) and why we went for the IS (balance between luxurious and performance). However, on the other end, the so-call pure enthusiasts (you know whom I am talking about) can never acknowledge that the IS is a capable competitor in this segment. I am going to say this one last time: driving dynamics may be the ultimate factor for you but that may not be the one for many other people, you know? Lighten up, look outside your own box then maybe you'll have a better perspective.Y'all have a good day"

BMW continues to win accolades for it's driving dynamics, but each car in this segment has it's contribution and attributes that make it desirable.In fact, I can't even remember anyone saying there is no compeition and *BMW is the one* and there is no other vehicle in this segment.I'm surprised you didn't notice some of the most ""enthusiastic"" people in this forum, were always hoping the other manufacturers somehow *got it right* for a price much less than a BMW."

5634,"September 20, 2006  1:13PM",jzalkin,"Lexus has stated the goal of the new IS is being exceeded so I would call it a success.  How many version of the 3 series is there (Sedans, M, coupe, convertible).  The IS has only one version (Sedan). It is selling 5k-6k a month - not bad for one variation. Lexus has even learned to stagger versions to keep interest up. How many BMW (current or potential) owners will visit Lexus when the IS500 comes? Would it be better for some if it had a manual for the 350 - yes.  Electronics can be turned off now - so it is a non issue.  Would the BMW be better without I-drive and enhanced interior design.  What about better reliability - sure.Here is a question - how many BMW 3 series did they sell in its 2nd generation in the US?  Not sure of answer myself, but it is amazing what Lexus (and Infiniti) is achieving in a short time frame.   Here is a statement I think holds true.  The Lexus satisfies luxury owners and is also bringing in enthusiasts as well.  Considering Gen 1 was not a sales success - there are a lack of repeat buyers.  Most are from other car makers (like Audi for me).  Imagine what will happen in Gen 3.  Considering it came down to the BMW & Lexus for me, I would say both have good products and that Lexus achieved its goal. I have never owned a Lexus (Audi, Ford Cobra, 300ZX, RX-7) and Lexus struck the right balance of Luxury, Driving Fun, and Overall Ownership Experience with the IS.  PS - Go read Club Lexus if you don't believe that enthusiasts are also buying it."
5635,"September 20, 2006  2:21PM",habitat1,"I have no doubt that the vast majority of IS owners are enthusiastic about their car.  As they should be.But it appears to me that Lexus, with the IS and GS, directed a lot of their marketing towards the ""driving"" enthusiast.  They even advertised the new GS with a new ""6-speed transmission"" (no reference to automatic) and showed a glimpse of somebody appearing to shift gears in BMW style winding Bavarian road commercial.  Stupid me stopped by a dealership between meetings and learned that it was nothing more than a slushbox with a manual shift capability.  I still drove it.  Dissapointing is an understatement. I have absolutely no problem giving Lexus credit where it is due.  The make a superbly crafted automobile, with great reliability.  Mercedes got a swift kick in the [non-permissible content removed] and we have all benefited by the increased competition.  To that, I say ""thanks Lexus"", and I mean it.Where I part company with some Lexus enthusiasts, is my belief the IS and GS could be significantly better at delivering on their marketing theme of going after the driving enthusiast.  Like Honda did with the $32k S2000 that gave the $60k Porsche Boxster S a run for their money.    It seems that some would like to forgive Lexus their sporting deficiencies and substitute techno-goodies and interior design for driving dynamics in the comparison with the 3-series.  Look, I understand trade offs.  I bought a TL 6-speed because of the balance of attributes - at a great price.  But you won't find me touting that it's comparable to the 3-series in driving dynamics.  And, the TL comes with a 6-speed, Brembo brakes, and a sport suspension that, in spite of FWD, apparantly beats the IS350 in a the slalom.So I'm not here to bash the IS350 for what it is.  But I will continue to call a spade a spade about what it isn't.  And I hope Lexus doesn't try to use a 1,000 watt 32 speaker Mark Levinson stereo to bribe more driving enthusiast's into succumbing to luxury as a substitue for what a serious sports sedan should be."

An IS350 with sport package and xenons is in the mid 39k range.  The same 330i, sp, leather, xenons was 40k range. But the BMW provides you with 4 years of free service - at least a $500 savings.  I'd say that'd make it a wash.  Except you can't really order an IS350: rather you wait months to see if Lexus will build your car.  You can customer order a BMW, not so a Lexus.  A BMW CCA rebate - available to any member of BMWCCA - nets you $500 too.  Where's the savings of the IS350?My 330i was 35.7k through European Delivery (msrp of 41k+).  Hmm, that's a good 3k+ below the cost of the Lexus. Not including free maintenance.Yeah the 335i is 1800 more expensive, so now you have a legit case for saying the 335 is more expensive than the IS350.  But then again, considering the IS350 is outperformed in everything but straightline by the 06 330i, it seems to reason for better driving in all circumstances - acceleration, handling, roadfeel, slalom, etc, the 335i is worth it to someone who cares about performance.  Of course, ED on a 335i with my options will only be 37-38k.  That's still cheaper than an IS350.  As of now, BMW already obliterates the IS350 in the form of M3, why wait for the 335?It's an ugly coupe.  It's overpriced.

Read the reviews of the 335i coupe and you'll see they're getting sub-5 second 0-60 times.  We're talking right in line with an M3.  and unlike an M3 the 3.0TT engine can be had in a sedan (why do you guys keep bringing up that hideous coupe in a sedan forum?) and it's a sub 40k car.  Furthermore chippers have already found the engine can be modded quite easily.  So again, unlike the M3, there's engine tuning that can drastically increase the performance.  What about warranties?  well, dinan always warranties bimmers with their chips.  My guess, by 2008 we'll see a Dinan chip that will give the 3.0TT over 400 hp (it's already got over 330 hp/330 tq - it's underrated) and 400 ft-lbs torque.

At $53K, I can get a little larger 3- series killer namned a Cadillac CTS-V. The 2008' Caddy CTS with over 300 hp. should give the 335i worry's. The CTS-V with 500-600 hp. will be much better than a 335i sedan or M3-M5 Sedan. I can't understand why BMW, priced this car way above a 330i when they are basically the same car. The only significant difference is a couple of small turbo's. I respect the 335i alot but I'd be damned to be a sucker or should I say a lolipop, on purchasing one in the low $50's when a M3 would only cost me a few bucks more in another year.

The 335i comes to our shores for a premium of less than $2,000 over the price of the 330i, like it or don't.  I just configured up a 335i with Metallic Paint, Sport Package and Premium Package (which is exactly as I would order it were I in the market today) and the MSRP was only $43,920.  Of course I wouldn't pay that as I enjoyed my ED trip so much last time around there is no way I'd ever order another new BMW without picking it up in Germany.  So, my price for the above 335i would most likely be just a hair shy of $39,000.Either way you look at it, the 335i is WAY cheaper than $53,000.Best Regards,Shipo"

I understand that we are talking about performance sedans here but at the same time these are designed to be everyday drivers. Majority of the buyers choose them because they are fun to drive and practical enough to use to commute everyday to work or to school. As a daily driver (or a commuter) shouldn't we at least take some other factors into consideration besides handling? On the other hand, I'll totally agree with the so-call enthusiasts if we are talking about the performance sports cars like habitat1's 911S. For the cars at that level, people rarely use them as daily drivers (although some do). They are more like a weekend fun car so people can take it out for a spin or take it to the track. It'll be totally ridiculous if we are taking the ventilated seats and cup-holders into the consideration if we are talking about the 911 here. As matter of fact I think people whom buy an automatic 911 (or even Boxster and Cayman) are nuts. However, the last time I checked, we are talking about the ""entry-level Luxury Performance Sedans"" here instead of ""Very expensive ultra sports cars"".I know this post is not going to change anybody's opinion (and yes, everyone's entitled to have their own) especially the hard-core enthusiasts like Blueguydotcom. However, I hope people can understand through this post that handling and driving dynamics is not the only factor to many buyers (to some of you maybe, but you are definitely not the majority) and to many others, maybe the ventilated seats are equally as important as BMW's awesome handling."

But I stand by the point that I may have not appropriately communicated:It is a subjective decision for everyone here to chose the car that is right for them.  And the Lexus IS350, G35, 335i, TL, and others are all legitimate choices, each with their own attributes.  That's not in dispute as far as I'm concerned.But, IMO, the attributes that make up what I would refer to as overall driving dynamics and performance have at least some significant element of objectiveness.  That fact that you would chose an IS with an automatic or I would chose a FWD TL 6-speed, or someone else would switch from a BMW to a Lexus means that we have made our own subjective choice on the attributes that are important to each of us.  It does not mean that the BMW is still not, based upon my test drives, the heads and shoulders leader in driving dynamics.   So, with all due respect to those who may forego rowing your own gears or, as I did, want a little more of a family sized sedan than the 3 series offered in 2004, that's our collective perogative.  But as far as driving dynamics goes, I for one am not so insecure as to give full credit to the BMW 335i where is is due.  And if Lexus (or Acura) really wants to compete with BMW in that arena, it isn't going to be with a slushbox only transmission choice and numb steering (Lexus) or a FWD platform (Acura), or an overweight AWD platform (Audi) or cupholders or ventilated seats or..."
5698,"September 27, 2006 12:49PM",louiswei,"habitat1, I totally agree with you that one should give BMW credit when credit is dued. I, for one, am completely impressed by the 335i. It'll be a harder decision for me if I choose to buy now instead of 6 months ago. However, I think I might come to the same decision ultimately because of 335i's hefty price and its still-ugly interior (IMO of course).However, let me raise this one issue...Since the 3er is the benchmark in this segment do everyone else (that's Lexus, Infiniti, Audi, MB and Acura) need to play BMW's game (driving dynamics)? What if one day say the IS or G or even TL surpass 3er's overall sales number does it still make the 3er the benchmark of the segment?

At the time I reasoned that even if I didn't end up with a new IS, some good competition certainly wasn't going to be a bad thing.  As more details on the new car worked their way into the public domain it became more and more apparent that the Gen2 IS wasn't going to be able to fulfill its promise.

No.  That having been said, given its relatively mushy handling, slushy transmission, unavailability of a true manual for the IS350, vague steering and cramped rear quarters, I found myself walking away wondering how the aforementioned executive could even remotely believe the IS was superior to the 3-Series in all areas.Best Regards,Shipo"

Lexus has taken a different approach. We are addressing this segment by offering two completely different models. The IS models offer incredible performance with all the luxury you would expect in a Lexus. Our ES 330 emphasizes the comfort and refined feel which Lexus is known for, and comes in a sophisticated and stylish exterior.coopnet asks: How does Lexus feel the IS250/IS350 compares to the 325i/330i?Bob Carter: The IS is a much better car!!He said the IS is a much better car.

No, they don't need to play BMW's game, but then they might want to tone down the ""sports"" sedan marketing theme as though they are going after the serious driving enthusiast.FWIW, I am similarly critical of Acura with the RL.  All this ""super-handling"" and ""300 horsepower"" advertising showing the car winding through the Bavarian Alps.  Well, it's NOT super handling compared to the 5-series and, as it turns out, it didn't even have 300 hp and felt downright sluggish compared to my TL 6-speed.  Not to mention no manual transmission option.  It seems like Acura's marketing folks wanted to have us believe the RL was a driving enthusiast's competitor to the 550i, but they forgot to tell their engineering department to deliver on the goods.Let me give you a positive example of a car that DID deliver on the goods - the $33,000 Honda S2000.  They, with limited self promoting fanfare, took on the best from BMW ($40k Z3), Mercedes ($45k SLK) and Porsche ($50k Boxster) and, IMO, beat them.  As a result, they didn't have to sing their own praises, every major car magazine and hordes of serious driving enthusiasts did it for them.________________________________""What if one day say the IS or G or even TL surpass 3er's overall sales number does it still make the 3er the benchmark of the segment?

A Honda Accord selling 400,000 cars a year doesn't mean it ""beats"" the 335i.  And the limited production Honda S2000, selling only 5,000 units a year didn't ""lose"" to the Z3 or Boxster.  Toll Brothers sells 10,000 luxury homes a year, but they don't ""beat"" Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater or Robie House in terms of architectural character.There is no doubt that there are a lot more ""semi"", ""non"" and ""sort of"" enthusiasts buying so-called sports sedans than there are serious driving enthusiasts.  And there are even more ""get me from A to B"" drivers perfectly happy with a Camry, Accord or, e-gads, a GM.  But, IMO, if Lexus, Acura, Audi or Infiniti insist on calling their vehicles ""sports sedans"", they cannot claim any victory until over BMW until serious driving enthusiasts can drive one in a sports sedan-ish sort of way and get out thinking that it performs better.  If they want to call them ""entry level luxury sedans"", then perhaps they have changed the metric in their favor.  For me, it's as simple as that. P.S.  And just to clarify, my definition of performance is not one dimensional like 0-60 times.  It is the entire ""sporting"" driving experience.  Which for a semi-enthusiast, might allow for a paddle shifting slushbox.  Not for me (and I accept I am flirting with subjectivity, now)."
5704,"September 27, 2006  3:26PM",louiswei,"A Honda Accord selling 400,000 cars a year doesn't mean it ""beats"" the 335i.Horrible example, you can't compare the Accord to 335i since they are in different class. Also, is S2000 the segment leader in general consensus? I don't think so, it's just a really good cheaper alternative to the Boxster and Z4 just like the G35 is to the 3er.I have no objection at all to crown the 3-series the performance leader in the class even if one day it does lose the sales crown. However, in this segment it's not all about performance (to the auto mags maybe). To me the reason I spend ~35K to get a sedan in this segment is because I want a car that's well-balanced between luxury and performance as well as being somewhat practical as an everyday driver and cars in this class deliver that. Some are more on performance (G and 3er) and some are more on luxury (C-class). FOR ME I think the IS strikes the perfect balance of the 2 and that's why now it's my daily driver. Otherwise, like you said if performance and fun to drive is all I want I will be probably better off to get a S2000 instead.Habitat1, you are a very lucky man to have a 911S as your fun car but some of us (actually many of us) don't have that luxury. So for me I need a car that can give me a little giddy up when needed but at the same time offers me comfort during my daily commute. I think by now everybody knows that I am by no means an enthusiast (probably not even a semi) so sports sedan to me means RWD and better handling than a midsize sedan.

""We plan to offer a compelling range of models and options with class-leading performance and luxury.""I was giddy watching the online unveiling of the IS350 in March of 05 .  The promise of 3 series performance with legendary lexus reliability had me nuts with anticipation.  I poured over every detail of the new IS350 and believed the hype.  Finally, a company with the economic and engineering muscle to accomplish anything promised to dethrone the 3 series. Alas, it didn't come to pass.  The IS350 was more expensive than my 3 by a long shot and far less fun. PS: you guys suck at the research thing. :P"
5707,"September 27, 2006  4:49PM",ggesq,"Ouch!That press release should quite some of the posters on this forum who believe that the IS was NOT marketed to driving enthusiasts. IMHO the IS series IS a good blend of performance, luxury, reliability and comfort. Lexus really needs, at this point, to hone in on the ""performance"" aspect and surely it would well be on its way to dethroning the 3er."
5708,"September 27, 2006  4:49PM",louiswei,"I didn't see anywhere in the article has a quote like ""The new IS will outperform the 3-Series in every category."" That's the exact quote according to shipo anyway but so far I still can't find the source of that.I am not going to get into another discussion of what's performance. For me performance is the combination of handling, road-feel, smooth tranny, acceleration and many others. One thing for sure is the IS did deliver on the acceleration part but maybe not so much of the other area. However on the other hand the 3er at that time was seriously behind the acceleration game but leading on the other area. Maybe the 330i has a better overall package on performance (which I think it does) but it's still fairly subjective.By the way, the IS has definitely delivered on the luxury part though."

5710,"September 27, 2006  5:14PM",habitat1,"I fully agree with you that a serious sports sedan - focused primarily upon driving performance - is not what everyone wants or needs in their daily driver.  (As evidence, you got an IS and I got a TL).  I'm not trying to talk you out of being happy with your car, just as I wouldn't want to defend my decision to get a TL.  But it initially appeared to me - and apparantly others - that Lexus marketed the IS350 as a serious sports sedan.  To that extent it falls short of the 335i.  False expectations were created.  That does not detract from its luxury attributes and the fact that for some it represents a better personal choice.   And, on that note, I'm going to conclude my rambling with a ""so what"" back to myself.  We are all, I assume, reasonably intelligent people who can set marketing pitches aside and make purchase decisions for ourselves.  The fact that Lexus might have been a bit ambitious in marketing the ""sport"" orientation of the IS is not the end of the world.  Nor is Acura's coining the term ""super handling"" for something that isn't.  Hell, when I bought my 2002 Honda S2000, it WAS a ""substitute"" for the ""there is no substitute"" Porsche Boxster.  And a pretty damn good one at that.    So take my comments with the assurance that I respect your decision to get a very nice car that has the balance of attributes that work for you.  If we all agreed on everything, this would be a boring world.  Although I wouldn't mind seeing a few more Robie Houses and a few less Toll Brothers houses in the future."

Don't play his game I do NOT think BMW is somehow invicible at ""their game"".  I'll argue vehemently that the S2000 was heads and shoulders a better roadster from a driving dynamics standpoint than the Z3/Z4 ever was/is.  Granted, the three series has been their strong suit.  But even the 5 series evolution, to a bigger, bulkier, heavier car, with a less driver oriented cockpit and stupid i-drive opened the door for competition.  I had hoped Acura would make a RWD V-8 RL with some of the same engineering creativity that went into the S2000 and give BMW a run for their money.  Wishful thinking.  But I hope that other manufacturers don't run for the hills rather than challenge BMW as the king of the sports sedans.  If nothing else, it will make BMW work harder, whcih is a good thing for consumers. O.K., I'm really done now."

People would ask about my 03 ZHP and I'd tell them it was a blast to drive but I'd never want to own it.  If possible, I'd own a car that was super fun and reliable.  I can't find such a thing, so I'm stuck leasing BMWs.  The Lexus brand, like the Caddy one, appeals to a certain group.  A group that places luxury above performance.  i'm not in that group.  It'd make life a lot easier if I could put up with a dowdy, bland car like a used Lexus LS430.  I could buy one now and just drive it for 6-7 years like a friend of mine.

While Jaguar has done some nice cars from a stylistic perspective, they haven't been world class in the driving dynamics department since the late/great XKE, the X-Type (a wannabe ELLPS) even less so.Before I got my 2002 530i I took a spin in a gorgeous S-Type, and as much as I LOVED how it looked, I felt like I was driving my Mom's Cadillac.  Ewwwww.  Well, it wasn't actually that bad, but ""ewwwww"" none-the-less.  Last year I drove an X-Type (even though I find it the ugly duckling of the Jaguar lineup) on the same day as I drove an IS350, an A4 and A3, a Saab SportCombi 2.0T and a 330i.  From a driving dynamics perspective, the only car that was worse (but not by much) than the X-Type was the Saab.True, from a quality control perspective, Ford seems to have helped Jaguar out a lot, however, from a design perspective; things are pretty much a disaster.

GM/Chrysler/Ford fail on all counts.  Back when I had my $32k Honda S2000, a guy I was golfing against in a club tournament joked that if I beat him, he would give me the keys to his Viper in exchange for my S2000's.  I beat him, but wasn't joking when I turned down the offer. If you can stomach a Cadillac, that's your perogative.  But I am quite certain my 911S Cabriolet has cost me less in the first year of depreciation than a Caddy would have.  And I expect that to be the case for at least the next 2-3 years.

Have found the X to be a supurb long distance touring car, and, capable of handling heavy rain and snow with no drama at all.

I believe the rust was coming from one of the mounting points (holes) for the chrome ""Jaguar"" plate in the middle of the trunk.  Maybe a one-time problem, but it was partially responsible for me getting rid of it.On another note, I was reading the Nov. R&T article on upcoming cars.

(Apologies to any S-type lovers out there, but that's just my personal opinion.. I don't see the point in getting the S-type with the X-type available.. from my perspective, either fork out for the XJ, or keep your pennies with the X-type).I'll eat my words for one exception to the S-type family - the S-Type R. It's a monster. 400 HP, and smooth as silk. I had the pleasure of getting to take a test drive in one of these... pretty much no words to describe how much I love driving this car.

5751,"October  2, 2006  1:59PM",louiswei,"Well it was going to be until BMW, didn't do anything to improve the cabin space and then on top of that they jacked the price sky high. When did BMW jack the price of 335i sky high? I think they raised the base price for around $1500K (I think it's around something like that but not sure though) and I don't think that's bad at all considering the 50+ HP boost and twin turbo. Well that's what a Acura spokesmouth told meCar-Buying 101: Never trust a salesman.Sometimes a common sense and a little bit of research can prevent yourself looking like a fool. Changing from FWD to SH-AWD during MMC...Rocky, what were you thinking? :P I was referring to the 2007's. GM should sell over 100K 2007' Caddy truck units.Again, ""should"", ""would"", ""ought to"", ""could"" is not going to change the reality that Caddy is NOT dominating the Luxury market as well as the Luxury SUV market. How is it possible that you can refer to the 07' when some of them are not even on the dealers' lot yet. Sometimes it's good to have hard facts to back up your own statement instead of just pulling random *beep* out of your rear. Even a trip down to your local dealership for a test drive (335i maybe?) could help your credibility.Lexus has like 5 or 6 different truck models. Is that really a fair comparo ?Like merc1 said, Lexus has only 3 truck models - GX, LX and RX. The hybrid is only a variant with different engine of the RX lineup so it's not a separate model by itself (example: 335i/328i, IS350/250 and your beloved CTS 2.8L/3.6L). Also, and yes the Land Cruiser has always come with Toyota badge and still is.They also don't make a large SUV either. Well if you call the LX 470 largeI did not see anywhere in your previous post stating anything about ""large SUV"". You only mentioned Caddy is dominating the ""luxury truck market"" by a landslide which by now we know that's not the truth."

5754,"October  2, 2006  2:12PM",kdshapiro,I would like to see the 3 series clean air diesel in the next few years. You can take your TL 300 hp SHAWD. I'll settle for no batteries and 50 mpg wrapped up in a BMW logo.
5755,"October  2, 2006  4:26PM",ggesq,"FYI,Honda will also be releasing its version of clean air diesel within the next 3 years along with vehicles equipped with fuel cells, flex fuel and will augment its venerable VTEC engine."
5756,"October  2, 2006  4:57PM",kdshapiro,"I'm not interested in Honda's version.  BMW has been building diesels for years in Europe and they have a lot of experience in diesel engines. BMW is ready today with a clean air diesel, but won't release the car in the US unless it can be sold in all 50 states."
5757,"October  2, 2006  5:17PM",ggesq,That's fine. Just wanted to let those who seek anything other than a BMW know that there are alternatives.
5758,"October  2, 2006  5:50PM",kdshapiro,"In the next 5 years, I'm going to bet there will be a lot of announcements regarding availability of clean air diesels."
5759,"October  2, 2006  5:55PM",dewey,My bias towards BMWs is based on performance/handling.In terms of fuel efficiency my bias is towards Honda. Honda's first attempt with diesels in in the form of the Accord  has received rave reviews in Europe and is  compared to the much more expensive BMW 320d.And dont forget this is Honda's first attempt. I am sure their second generation diesels will be substantially improved.Also Honda is far ahead in terms of developing a mainstream fuel cell auto than any other manufacturer to date.
5760,"October  2, 2006 10:12PM",rockylee,"Ummmm, I doubt it because none of those cars will be over-priced like the 335i. For god sakes they put pleather in a $40K car. What's up with that ? :surprise: Even my Moms G6 has Nuance. :surprise: Rocky"
5761,"October  2, 2006 10:31PM",blueguydotcom,"Rocky, A 335i sedan with leather is 40.8k including shipping."
5762,"October  2, 2006 10:59PM",kdshapiro,"Rocky - try to custom order Lexus, try to custom order a BMW. Come back to the board, tell us which one is easier. The German manufacturers allow the whole car to be customized. Go to Porsches' website. Customize a Porsche. On a $100K Porsche you can add $200K options.Leather has zero, let me repeat, zero effect on 0-60, skidpad, slalom etc."

5766,"October  2, 2006 11:30PM",spiritinthesky,"Overpriced 335i?I see you like to post a lot.  A whole lot.  As in, your last 10 posts were at 2;38 p.m. through 3:14 p.m. TODAY.  And I suspect your previous 10 were in the previous hour.  Unfortunately, the majority of these posts seem to be cluttered with misinformation.  Very cluttered.My nephew is picking up a 335i coupe fully loaded with premium package (leather included), sport package, cold weather package and navigation at the factory (European Delievery Program) for $43,500 in December.  For that price, they are throwing in a free session at BMW's performance driving school when he has time to go in the spring.  By all measures of true quality and engineering, that is a very good deal.But I guess if you are inclined to buy GM junk for $20,000 to $30,000 that depreciates to about half that value in the first 18 months, $43,500 might seem like a lot of money.  Or if you are inclined to have a non-challenging day job that allows you to spend hours posting 20-30 times a day on Edmunds, $43,500 might seem unachievable.  I suspect you would be right on that count.  The world is full of underachievers.  BMW doesn't need to sell to them to be successful and personally, I hope they never lower themselves to doing that.  Leather seating surfaces do not represent what makes BMW a superiorly engineered car, in case you've never driven one.  You can put all the leather lipstick in the world on the GM pig and guess what you still have??? :confuse:If, in fact, $43,500 (or less, without the extra options) is too much for you to stomach, then make your choices accordingly.  But don't chastise those who can afford a 335i as buying a car that is overpriced.  Or suggest that a G6 with Lay-Z-Boy leather and Lay-Z-Boy handling can even be compared to a Honda Accord in quality, let alone a 335i.  Or as an alternative, you might consider posting less and working harder so that eventually that $43,500 isn't so far out of reach.  My company attorney (that I pay), makes enough in 1 hour a day to buy a new Ferrari 430 every year.  Think about that when you are on your 20th post tomorrow."
5767,"October  2, 2006 11:49PM",designman,"This argument about BMW being overpriced has been going on since the 70s.
