0,"March 23, 2002  7:04PM",cybersol,"entry level performance luxury sedans are a hot area for car manufacturers and enthusiasts alike.  these sedans show their performance by being fun to drive and handling well.  they show luxury by offering leather and some of the important creatures comforts found in the most luxurious upscale sedans. the selection of vehicles that compete in the space is vast and varied.the benchmarks which define this are the bmw 330 and the audi a4 3.0.  but there are many contenders, such as acura tl-s, chrysler 300m, jaguar x-type, infiniti i35, mercedes c-class, volvo s60 t5.  some companies have contenders that emphasize performance lexus is300 or luxury lexus es300.  and the field is continously growing, with the recent additions being the cadillac cts and infiniti g35.the common charateristics of this entry level perfomance luxury group seem to a price around 30 to 40k (us dollars) and 0-60 times between six and eight seconds.with this wide variety of cars targeted at a similar market segment, the choices for our own personal car are great.  but with all these choices, it is hard to understand and personally evaluate all these options.  so this topic has been created to start a discussion on the relative merits and personalities of the cars available in this entry level performance luxury field."
1,"March 25, 2002  5:54AM",merc1,"i personally think that with a few tweaks the c320 could also sit at the top of this group.  it's still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than mercedes would lead you to believe.   the c320 ""sport"" needs to have it's suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride.  mb also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package.  the c240's 6-speed wouldn't hurt either if offered on the c320, though it needs to be ""fixed"" first. that said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new a4 3.0.   the a4 easily has the best interior of any sub-40k car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite.   the single thing i don't like about the a4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car.  this trim doesn't match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway.   this is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40k.  the upcoming a4 convertible, coupe and s4 will all be winners. the bmw 330i is now an old favorite, but i'm (of all people) starting to tire of the 3-series just a bit, save the m3 variants.   i was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling.  i hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models. the acura tl-s is easily my favorite fwd car in this class.  wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver.  nice price, seats and what not, not hard to see why the tl is so popular.  this car's main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc.  otherwise a standout. lexus es300.  nice, but not my type of car at all.  this is one for the buick set.  the is300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis.  styling is also in question here, it simply doesn't look like a 35k car (grown).  the interior is gawd-awful.  bet on the next is300 being done right from the start.  in their defense toyota didn't initially intend for this car to be sold in the u.s. so it was a rush job. the cts holds the greatest unrealized potential here.  i've seen several now, and each time i see one they look better and better.  again like the c320, is300 the car has interior issues.  the dash feels like it was made by rubbermaid.  if you're going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother?  half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car???  the seats are very good though, as is the handling.  a work in progress. the g35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces.  another great engine, waiting to drive this one.don't really care much for the x-type.  if i were a jaguar man i'd be truly pissed at ford and jaguar for this one.  they are actually selling a fwd x-type in england and i've read where they're thinking about selling it here!  hell no.  the car should have been rwd not awd.  some will tell you that this was done to compete with audi.  thats bs, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, without spending the money to convert the car to rwd.  it is a good looking car though and that jaguar ""leaper"" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me. the chrysler 300m is about as close to an audi that american cars come.  this new 300m ""special"" is truly a good looking car inside and out.  one problem: where is the performance????  a 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable.  something is not right here.  some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, chrysler needs to let some mb engineers have a look at this car.  the heavier e320 with less power is faster.   i still like this car, but it's no lust object once you get past the great styling.  m"
2,"March 25, 2002  7:06AM",fredvh,i am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. the price difference between these two is approx. 6k (non-type s acura). is the es300 worth 6k over the tl? i don't know because i have never owned a tl but i am familiar with the es300(previous generation). supposedly the 2002 es300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the tl? of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. does the tl compare with the es300 in both of these categorys? i am not familiar with the honda co. are prices lower than lexus for service work? i would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some tl owners.
3,"March 25, 2002  5:02PM",blueguydotcom,"great handling, rwd, excellent engine and the best warranty around.  easy winner."
4,"March 25, 2002 11:04PM",hungrywhale,"and no manual tranny.  that may not matter to you, but it most certainly does matter to me and many other enthusiast drivers.so imo, it's not even on the board, let alone the 'easy winner'."
5,"March 26, 2002 12:44AM",riez,"one beauty of bmw 3 series is that there are so many models to choose from.  almost half of all buyers in america don't get the basic rwd 4 door sedan.  besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices, you can get coupe, convertible, awd, station wagon, and super-high performance m-series!!!hungrywhale...  i concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical!!!"
6,"March 26, 2002  8:20PM",blueguydotcom,"good grief, so you wait 9 months for the manual.  even with an auto, i prefer to every car listed and i never have owned an auto and never thought i'd enjoy driving a car with an auto.  that's what value, performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car.  once the g has a stick there is not another sedan under the m3 that i'd consider."
7,"March 26, 2002  9:02PM",hungrywhale,"i'll give it a fair shot when the manual comes out, but i'm just flat-out not interested in an auto.  i don't care how fast it is.  it's not about the speed, it's about the driving experience and having more control over the car."
8,"March 26, 2002  9:45PM",blueguydotcom,"i understand it's not about the speed.  i really don't care if the car won't do over 100 as i rarely break the century mark.  what i do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto, i can get it when i want it.  will i buy an auto-equipped g?  in all likelihood, no.  i desperately want to drive the 6 speed."
9,"March 27, 2002 12:00AM",hungrywhale,it sounds like you know why i won't even put it on my list (let alone at the top) until the manual comes out.
10,"March 27, 2002  2:00AM",riez,"is there such a thing as an automatic-only true performance sedan?  not in my book.  certainly not in europe or asia.  only in america is such an oxymoron possible.  sad.if or when the manual g35 comes out and the coupe version, then the g35 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment."
11,"March 27, 2002  2:55AM",wishnhigh1,"if i had to rank the entry lux performance sedans, here is what i would choose:audi a4 3.0(lots of bang for the buck, loads of style and loads of luxury)cadillac cts( decent btfb, good handling, non-lemming style)infinity g35(tons of bftb, good luxury, but completely boring exterior and even more boring of an interior)bmw 325(very little bftb, excellent handling/build quality/resale, classy looking but too conservative for me)saab viggen(almost zero bftb, spotty build quality, but the damn coolest style in the world). everything else is not worth my time"
12,"March 27, 2002  5:06AM",shipo,"hey my friend, dig this, in australia, the only 5-series that can be had with a manual gearbox is the m5!  yeah, right, not the 525i, 530i, 535i or the 540i, they are all automatic only.  :-(best regards,shipo"

(see the edmund's bmw 3-series discussion).  i hope in your defense, reiz, that you drove the automatic infiniti g35, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn't classify as a performance sedan. i value your opinion and others as well.again, i'm not flaming you, but i try to be an informed consumer before i buy anything. that is the reason that i will drive every car that i'm interested in and make my choice from there. i'm also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car i'm shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.cheers!"
14,"March 27, 2002  5:00PM",hungrywhale,"i think what riez and i are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them but any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan needs at least the option of a manual tranny.  manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.there's nothing at all wrong with automatics, but i sure don't want one."

16,"March 27, 2002  6:23PM",dave330i,"in this class, the best bang for the buck has to be is300, assuming one can live with the styling. i guess i'm one of the few that likes the old a4 styling to the new. isn't the new a4 pushing 3600 lbs. now? that's pretty heavy for this class."
17,"March 27, 2002  7:06PM",blueguydotcom,"even at 29k for a 35k msrp is300, i passed on it.  now i never drove a manual one (they weren't out yet) but even with a manual, given the car's horrible drive-feel, poor interior and lethargic steering, i don't think i'd go near one.  they're not up to audi/bmw/mb/infiniti."
18,"March 27, 2002  8:42PM",wishnhigh1,"never liked a lexus, and probably never will. i would rather drive the cts. there is always something that irritates me about them. i would buy the is as a toyota but not a lexus...i personally think lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character. toyota deserves something like it though. also, i don't think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck, considering the g35 is the same price with 260 horsies."
19,"March 27, 2002  8:46PM",dave330i,"""i would buy the is as a toyota but not a lexus""how else are they going to get that extra $5k from you then? reasonably equipped g35 goes for $33k or so."
20,"March 27, 2002  9:10PM",riez,"i couldn't have said it better myself.  i'll let you lead services!  mbarto...  i most certainly will test a g35 manual if and when it finally comes out.  i promise!!!  automatics make nice luxury sedans and maybe even sporty luxury sedans.  but not performance sedans or luxury performance sedans.  (i don't even consider the 540ia sport truly worthy, though it is as close as one can get in an automatic.  if i could just get my wife to drive a manual....)"
21,"March 28, 2002  7:43AM",mbarto,"thanks riez! let me know when you do.  i'm sure you'll get a chance before i will since i won't return until december. i am curious of how it compares to the bmw's. you can speak from experience, so i'll value your opinion.it does make a difference being married. (lol!  see the latest discussions on the infiniti g35 vs bmw 330i board).  first, i'm fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual. not that she prefers that, her first choice is an automatic.  but she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice i'm doing out here, and knows that this car is for me first, family second. of course, it helps my cause when i let her buy a new dining room set last month, and new living room drapes this month. bribes do help! whatever i finally decide, i'm sure she'll be happy."
22,"March 29, 2002 12:07AM",riez,"mbarto... as regards the ""bribes"" issue, you've figured out one of life's great truism:  you get what you want so i can get what i want."""
23,"April  5, 2002 10:34PM",cybersol,"so if someone were looking to purchase a new performance luxury sedan today, what cars would they have to take a look at and test drive?  lets say they only had time to look at five?what five would they have to look into?"
24,"April  6, 2002 12:16AM",riez,"since it has to have a manual transmission and should be rwd (awd/4wd adds too much weight and complexity) and has to be fun to drive hard...1.  bmw 3 series manual2.  lexus is300 manual3.  cadillac cts manual4.  lincoln ls6 manualif you want affordable and can go fwd, then add nissan maxima 6-speed with lsd and maybe altima 3.5se 5-speed.try to get car with lsd.  inline 6s are magnificently smooth engines.possible future car:  infiniti g35 sedan when it finally gets the 6-speed manual."
25,"April  7, 2002  3:22PM",coolguyky7,"the tl should be up for redesign in a few years so a tl would be outdated in the not so far future.  and besides, it seems like everyone who drives an acura drives the tl.  i love the es300.  some say it looks bloated; i don't think it does.  at the 3/4 angle, it looks impressive.  the interior is as nice as a car can get.  if i had the money, i would buy an es300 in a heartbeat.  i never did like the past ones' boring styling...especially since the last two generations were nearly twins.  go with the es.  besides, lexus' quality is ahead of acura's."
26,"April  7, 2002 10:59PM",kdshapiro,"the new es is a very smart looking car. notwithstanding any engine issues though, i think there are direct price competitors like the i35 that offer better overall value on paper. now i haven't driven either new model, i did drive the older es300 and it did it's job very well. they are both great cars. lexus for legendary reliability and resale value, infiniti for up-to-date features."
27,"April  8, 2002 10:32PM",blueguydotcom,"um...you left off the infiniti g35 and it's bland, boring brother the i35 (the es300's competition).29k gets someone a 4 door 260 hp performance entry level luxury sedan with all sorts of goodies."

29,"April  9, 2002  9:43PM",blueguydotcom,"go drive one.  they're a blast and for the money they're a steal.  if someone wants entry level performance luxury at a great price, the g's really tough to beat.  save for bmw, it sort of stands head and shoulders over most of its competition."
30,"April 12, 2002  2:53PM",merc1,"well i'm a benz fan first and foremost, but the a4 3.0 cvt just offers more for the money.  the a4 has a better interior, the top a4 engine (compared to the c240, which is the base c) and it's styling is at least as good as the benz if not better.   both makes pay for scheduled maint during the warranty period.    neither car will be ""low maintanence"" after the warranty runs out, especially the audi with it's fairly different transmission.   if you're priced these cars and they've come out equal go for the audi it's the better value here. m"
31,"April 14, 2002  8:09AM",popovs,"i think both are excellent(sp?) cars, however neither one is a low maintenance automobile. that is to say neither brand is known for low maintenance.  what they do offer is luxury and performance in an aesthetically pleasing package and, some would argue, a superior ownership experience.as someone has said before, every manifacturer makes lemons - some more than others - but the internet is not the best place to find information about that.  most people are just venting and are not representative of the owner community.  although i can not speak as to the driving merits of the cars, i suspect that they are similar since i've heard (read) good things about both the a4 cvt and the c240.  something to keep in mind is that anytime a new product is offered by the industry, it usually takes a couple of years for the company to work out all the bugs in the technology.  both cars are relative newcommers to the market.  the facts that they are made by distinguished companies and use proven powerplants does not speak conclusively as to how reliable the cars will be as a whole.since you are already looking for alternatives to the mb because of reliability concerns, it may be worth your time to look at other alternatives than the audi.  as someone has suggested in the help me choose! forum, try looking to lexus for the answer.  they seem to make reliable cars that are also cheap to keep running.  of course now we get into the issue of european vs asian luxury ..."
32,"April 17, 2002  9:23AM",popovs,"it has come to my attention that as of late mb has taken a hit in its reputation.  people have been quick to point at the recent survey results - both european and domestic - that say mercedes is no longer reliable.  these surveys show that statistically speaking mb has as much as doubled the amount of repairs that they do under warranty.  i won't deny these findings, but i will try and justify them.  1st and foremost, mb has and is comming out with newer designs every year, updating the cars both inside and out.  anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out.  secondly, according to mbspy.com, mercedes accounted for ~half of the profits by dcx last year.  i think mb is being used as a cash cow to keep jeep and co affloat, thereby driving mercedes to cost-cutting through corparate pressure.  lower quality parts equal lower overall car quality.these two should get things going ... feel free to agree or disagree."
33,"April 17, 2002  7:37PM",mvargo1,"there is not much to debate on this subject.  if you want a reliable car you buy japanese.  if you want a drivers car you used to have to buy european.  the japanese just do quality better and more consistantly than anyone else.  you also get a lot more car for your money with a japanese vehicle.  there was a time when the europeans built the best driving cars in the world.  sadly for them those days are passing.  the japanese keep building cars that are closer and closer to european driving dynamics (is and gs series lexus(lexi?), and q45 and g35 infiniti's)  while the europeans quality especially daimler/chrysler just is not keeping up."

35,"April 18, 2002 11:12PM",cybersol,"i'm interested more towards performance than luxury.  also value is an important component for me.  although i have the money to buy these cars, i also have other fun things and places to spend it.  i'm looking to buy the car and keep it for around 7-10 years.  its very sunny with no snow here as well.  i also want an automatic or cvt(gasp).so right now, the five i am going to look at more closely are as follows:1) bmw 330i2) audi a4 3.0 cvt3) infiniti g354) acura tl-s5) nissan altima 3.5 sethe bmw represents the top of the class, but it also has the highest price.  the altima represents the most performance oriented family car, which is a cheaper class of cars.  the bmw and altima will bracket the value equation.  the other three all have the potential to compete for my dollars.cars that are missing, is300 too small, while the styling of the cts, s60 t5, and 9-5 aero are not for me.  the es300 and i35 don't have enough performance for me.  everything more expensive than a comparibly equipped 330i was also excluded.what do you guys think? anything missing?thanks,cybersol"
36,"April 18, 2002 11:50PM",riez,"cybersol...  i can't fathom why you would want to go with slushbox, but that is your loss.comparing fwd to rwd is like apples to oranges.not sure what sort of real price range you are looking at.  the 330i with options might push $40,000.  you might really consider the much less expensive 325i.  an altima 3.5se with few options might have a $25,000 msrp.read motor trend's review of i35.  their's had more than enough performance.  0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds, fastest in their comparison test.  and it can be had with a sport package.  but you might be better off with a loaded maxima se or gle, saving thousands off the i35.you might also consider volkwagen passat.  that can also be had with awd.  if you like awd, the jag x-type should be on your list.from the domestic corner, you might also consider a lincoln ls 6 or 8.  or chrysler 300m.surprised your list excludes the mercedes-benz c-class. and if you can live with a fwd automatic, a loaded camry or accord v-6 or avalon might be acceptable near the altima's price range."
37,"April 19, 2002  1:07AM",cybersol,"sorry to disappoint with the slushbox, but if we were all the same life would be boring (and there would only be 1 car type). i would prefer rwd, but the best fwd's (torque sensitive steering) are getting close enough to bring the acceptable price premium for rwd down. price range is 25-40k as you mention.passat, 300m, 325i, are too slow for me.  the c classes are either too slow or more expensive than the bmw.  i would choose the bmw over the x-type, as they are similarly priced and i live in sun country.the maxima (better value than the i35) is a good suggestion, and i am considering that equally with the altima at the lower end.my wife loves camry's, but i'm looking for excitement.  slushbox or not.thanks,cybersol"
38,"April 19, 2002  2:14AM",kdshapiro,"the new altima is great as my friends just bought one. however, dollar for dollar i think the maxima is the over-all winner for a fwd car. if you can live without the amenities of the i35 the gle with leather, sunroof, bose can't be beat. i've owned two maximas. me! i recently made the jump to the 330i, and it's been worth every penny. however the g35 owners are very passionate about their choices. for a couple of dollars more than the maxima, hovering around the i35 i guess, the tl-s can't be beat either.i understand when it comes down to it, you pick what you think has the right combination of value, performance, luxury and the right type of car for you. for every person it is different. when i got the bmw i was cross-shopping suvs, mini-vans, and fwd passenger cars to see what struck my fancy, and i was ready to get an explorer."
39,"April 19, 2002  2:18AM",riez,"cybersol... excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible.  i can't get too excited about fwders.  certainly not a slushbox fwder.not sure what you mean about ""the best fwders (torque sensitive steering)"".very powerful fwders tend to suffer from severe torque steering.  use of equal length half-shafts and limited slip differential can help, but not completely eliminate.  the laws of physics remain.  when the drive wheels and steering wheels are one and the same, and you have a powerful motor, you'll get some torque steering.do you have kids?  plan to in near future?  if not, have you considered any coupes or convertibles?  they can be a bit more exciting."
40,"April 19, 2002  3:28PM",dave330i,"""excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible.""agreed. unfortunately, most american drivers don't seem to get it. they care about silly stuff like 0-60, 1/4 mile, hp & torque numbers, but choose to miss out on the fun part of driving."
41,"April 20, 2002  8:18AM",cybersol,"riez, you have heard of speed sensitive steering?  this varies the power steering boost as with the speed.  acura claims to have torque sensitive power steering on the tl-s (not the tl though).  this would supposedly vary the power steering boost with the torque being applied.  and that in theory could eliminate a large amount of torque steer found in powerful fwd cars.  it still doesn't eliminate the fwd tendency to under steer due the the drive wheels being the same as the turning wheels."
42,"April 20, 2002  4:49PM",riez,"cybersol...  there are two types.  those tied to engine output and those tied to road speed.  i have heard that the latter are superior, since you can vary engine speeds (rpms) a lot, depending upon gear being used and speed, even while driving relative steady speeds.  better systems vary boost on road speed, since you normally need more assist at low speeds, regardless of engine rpms.here is all that the lengthy full-color tl brochure says:  ""steering: variable power-assist rack-and-pinion"".  this is off the tech specs on page 30.  i cannot find a single mention of the steering system anywhere else in the brochure.  so if acura thinks its variable assist power steering system is special, they are keeping it a secret.  this large brochure covers both the tl and tl type s."

but on the acura website.  tl -> specifications -> body/suspension/chassis it says:steering type tl type s - torque-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering 3.2tl - speed-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steeringhere's the link if you want to check it out:http://www.acura.com/model_tl/tl_spec_results.asphard to find, but not a secret."
44,"April 21, 2002  1:50PM",riez,"cybersol...  from what i've read, the better variable power assist system is tied to road speed, not engine rpms.  once you get a car up to 25 mph or more, there isn't much need for assist, even if your rpms decline due to turning or downshifting.  and certainly once you hit 45 mph or more there isn't much need for assist no matter what happens to your rpms.but keep in mind that torque steering isn't due to the steering system.  it is due to other factors.  can be very pronounced in powerful fwders.  corrective actions include limited slip differentials and equal half-shafts.  need to provide equal power simultaneously to drive wheels.from standing start, floor your car.  see if the wheel pulls in one direction.  you'll have to correct with the steering wheel (to keep the car straight) but by then you'll have already encountered the torque steering.  you can also notice it if you are aggressively accelerating in a curve.  wheels pull you out of your intended direction and you have to correct."

49,"April 27, 2002  9:37PM",1pierce,"not so fast.  there is merit to the ""nationality based"" debate.  let me explain to you why japanese cars have higher quality (in terms of reliability) than american or european cars.  the reason is cultural.americans have always had an adventurous, entrepreneurial spirit.  we take chances.  its not in our nature to ""accept"" things as they are.  i think this is somewhat genetic, since the vast number of us are descended from immigrants - aren't we all, really - people who took tremendous risk, and had great courage to brave the unknown for the promise of a new and better life.  as such, in areas of design, we bore very easily.  americans are always looking for the next great thing, the next new design, the next technology breakthrough.  europeans, especially germans, are like this about cars, if not about everything else.  the us auto industry is always ready to chuck the old and start over from scratch - witness chrysler and ford over the last two decades.  as such, our products are usually stylish and inventive, but not very refined - see minivans, suv's, cab-forward, night-vision, etc..the japanese by comparison have a culture that is traditional and thousands of years old.  they have made an entire culture out of honoring tradition and the status quo.  we had to yank them kicking and screaming into the 20th century after world war ii.  i know this is somewhat simplistic, but bear with me.  what the japanese are good at is taking an idea and refining it year after year, until it is near perfect.  there is very little innovation or risk taking.  that is why the cars are so bland.  when was the last time you saw a new technology invented in japan?  vcr's, computer technology, cell phones, the microwave oven...all american inventions that are better built by the japanese.  the same goes for cars.  most innovations come from the us or germany, with some safety innovations coming from scandinavia (give up the turbos and 5-cylinders, already those are as refined as they're going to get!).anyway,...when you distill it down to its essence, this is why toyotas and hondas never break.  its also why they are no more than transportation appliances.  and, this is why the best performance cars from japan will always be knock-offs (albeit sometimes very good ones) of something somebody else does better and more originally.i'll step off my soap box now, and await your wailing."

(btw: in the same test, the lincoln ls8 sport they tested turned in acceleration numbers of: 0 &#150; 60 in 7.5 and the quarter mile in 15.7 at 90.  this was my previous car.  so, it seems reasonable that my w8 feels quicker &#150; setting aside the notorious un-reliability of everyone&#146;s &#145;butt dyno&#146;!)does it pull the same lateral g as the g35 or a bmw 3 series w/sport package.  almost certainly no.  but with more aggressive rubber, i expect that it will provide enough grip for entertainment value at any sane public road speed. just my opinions.cheers,- rayoff shortly to put on a few more &#145;break-in&#146; miles at lunch . . ."

74,"June 28, 2002  4:41PM",cmnott,"congrats on your a4! look, no question you were quite gracious about my comments about the a4. i was so disappointed with the new styling because i always wanted the previous a4. so to see how it looks, personally, i hate it. maybe it is just me, but i just couldn't come to grips with it.i found the a4 felt slow reacting whereas the jag had better reflexes. but also felt smaller.  i think it is unfair and untrue to say the ""ford"" thing, i think that has been addressed, whether people choose to beleive it or not.  the 6 speed was poor, there is no other word for it, but i really did enjoy the automatic (as far as one can).  the jaguar had a much, much better transmission but i was not particularly enamored with the clutch.  the steering, imo, was better than almost all. i just couldn't justify the price difference when a certain car is trying to make an impression in a hot segment.like i said before, there are no losers in this segment, but i think it is  safe to say none of us would go for the winner of the comparo, eaweg and jagxboytype!"
75,"June 28, 2002  6:39PM",jagboyxtype,"i totally agree that it is all personal preference, and i really believe that most all of the cars in this segment, especially the a4, s60, and x-type, are some of the best.  i don't think there is ""a best"" car here since everyone has different needs and preferences.  they all have their own ups and downs, but i think the benefits of each of these cars certainly outweighs most of their negatives as well.on the x-type article:i read that autoweek article too, and it scared me a bit before i went to check out the x-type and made me check the competition before going with the car in the end.  jaguar seems to have solved most all of those problems in the current x-types though, and the ones being produced now don't have any of those problems.  i also found two articles in my local newspaper that were on early x-type problems.  the initial article was much like the autoweek one, and the second one came out a pretty long time after the first one; it was a follow-up on how those initially unhappy customers were doing after jaguar north america finally contacted them and worked on their cars.  they had factory technicians go out and examine the cars and all of that - they even bought back a car and gave the owner a much better new one.  jaguar was a bit late in contacting them (and i agree that it took too long), but they did get most all of their x-types fixed and the customers ended up being very pleased with their cars in the end.yes, some of the very early production x-types lived up to their old jaguar reputation for being problematic as the article shows, but the newer ones are much better both in quality and reliability.  jaguar did many things and worked hard to correct the faults of the early cars, and they even had the whitley engineering center, who designed the driveshafts for the x-type, go through five or six different new designs until they finally got it perfect.i can personally say from experience that the x-type is not in any way a problem car, at least the ones being produced now, especially as my own car has had no problems at all.  it initially had the drippy windshield whiper jets, but the dealership simply tightened a valve on the underside of the hood before giving me the car, and nothing has gone wrong since i've had it.  i really love even just being around the cars as it has been so good.again, it is all personal preference.  when i sat in the jag for the first time, it just felt right.  i hadn't even adjusted the seat and it just felt so perfect.  every time i sit in it, everything is perfect.  the whole car is that way for me, and i bet your audi is the same for you.and if anyone is paying off the media it's bmw and infiniti, and it appears that infiniti is paying the most.  i don't think jag even has the funds to do that:-) (although, global sales were just up 62% in april, and they've had record-setting sales for the past four consecutive years now.)and, it is very nice to speak to someone civilized on this board.  take care of your car!____________________________blueguydotcom-i actually own my car, we paid the dealer in full when we got it.  the only incentive for the x-type is a pretty good lease price (i just checked yesterday), but even that has been complained about and called false advertising by many as it is only for the 2.5 litre model with no options (not even paint is included in the advertized price for the lease!).  it's also ending in a few months, and then prices will be even higher.  i'd like to see how people complain about it being very expensive when the 2003 prices come out, as they are even higher than this year.  oh well, it is a jaguar after all, and a great car on its own.  option packaging has been reorganized for 2003, however, so getting things like sunroofs is easier."

77,"June 29, 2002 12:48AM",jagboyxtype,"the x-type is jaguar's fastest selling car right now, it accounts for over half of all jaguar's sales, and it has boosted jaguar's global sales by 62% since january 2002; and that number was recorded from april.  in february of 2002, jaguar's u.s. sales alone were up 105% compared to feb. 2001, largely because of the x-type.  x-type's sales have been taking off after a slower start since the events of 9-11.recorded in may, 16,171 x-types have been sold since january 1, 2002 in the u.s.  of that number, 2,961 were sold in may.  jaguar is very happy with its sales.  also, the x-type is supposed to be lower volume than many of its competators as it is a jaguar.  never the less, this compares well with 16,395 audi a4s and 16,339 volvo s60s sold so far this year.  the infiniti g35 has only sold 8,731 units so far, and 11,237 cadillac cts's have been sold in 2002 as well."

92,"September 15, 2002  3:18AM",kdshapiro,"rp - you are correct the 330i is a sedan, just like the g35, just like the acura, just like the audi and all of the cars that were compared in the latest edmunds round-up. none of them are sports cars. edmunds calls them entry level luxury sport sedans. the fact is the 530i also gets very high marks in the performance department, except the 530i is a true luxury sport sedan, again not a sports car.now the 530i outclasses all of the above in terms of amenities, but it would be interesting to see from a strict performance viewpoint, how it compares to the above or even compares to the 330i.although in the scheme of things size has little to do with performance - as another poster pointed out there are cars the same size as the 330i that are nowhere near it in terms of overall performance. note the salient word is overall.also the fact that it is a compact has nothing to do with it's interior room. the g does not have marginally much more room and if you read edmunds round-up, it does state there is sufficient room in the car for 4 adults in the 330i. unless you regularly transport 5 people and the two people in the back seat absolutely have to have the reclining seats, in my opinion the amount of extra space in the g doesn't make that much of a difference. it might to you, but then you get to vote with your dollars. if i regularly transported 5 people however, none of the cars in the edmunds round-up would be on my list.it seems clear to me based on the reviews i've read over the last couple of years, when only talking about the sport of driving in this segment, the 330i is the benchmark."

107,"September 22, 2002  1:13AM",jagboyxtype,"oh, that's too bad.  it's also too bad that they failed to notice that:-the x-type does have an indash cd-player, which is standard on 3.0 litre models.-out of the group of european sport sedans (e.g. bmw 3, mercedes-benz c, audi a4) the jaguar x has the most powerful engines.-the jaguar alpine sound system is rated very highly.  the auto's section of my newspaper rated the jaguar alpine system the top system out of premium european cars in a big comparison test of car stereos.  lexus won the japanese premium car sound system category with its ml system.-the car is a wonderful handler; for example, it outperformed the c-320 sport in that deleted post comparison, and although it does not have the class-leading acceleration times, it is only about 0.2 second behind the 3-series and is in the top end of its class when it comes to performance (0-60 in 6.3 seconds - car&driver; 0-60 in 6.5 seconds - road&track).  with its awd, it can corner like no other car.-braking performance from 60mph is just two feet longer than the porsche 911 gt2 (116 feet), at 118 feet.  thus, it stops in the same distance as a smaller bmw m-roadster (118 ft.).  brakes are from the larger s-type.-connoly leather and wood are all standard in the jag, and leather and wood are only optional (if available) in competor's models.-it has the most rigid structure in its class, over 30% higher than the previous class leader.-synthetic interior materials (e.g. plastics and not-leather soft-touch areas) are made by the same company from the same materials from the same machines that manufacture synthetic materials for audi's a6 and new a8, which are ""industry leading"" according to many.-the x-type does weigh a little more than a rwd car as it carries an extra differential and drive shaft for its awd, but that doesn't seem to hurt its performance.  it actually helps it in many ways.  also, for instance, it weighs less than an audi a4, cadillac cts, and lincoln ls.-there is some engine noise entering the cabin, but even wispers are still audible from passengers.  plus, it's a sports-sedan, so the engine is supposed to have a nice little note to it.  many reviewers have enjoyed the sound the x-type's engine makes.  there is also almost no wind noise as exterior mirrors, etc. were sculpted from windtunnel tests at pininfarina and high-speed tests on the nardo bowl in italy as well as the nurburgring in germany.-clutch: yes, some people dislike its feel, yet others like it because it is not difficult to use.  i believe that it was motorweek that stated it felt like a bmw clutch.-pricing: you can get a base x-type for around $29,000 - $30,000 with leather and wood, manual transmission, metallic paint, etc.  option packages have been re-organized to allow more individual options to be ordered.  competators like the mb c-class sedan start at around $31,000 without leather and wood, but vinyl and plastic.about the only virtue the x-type doesn't have are memory seats.  beyond those, it's one hellofa car.  i doubt it would still be making up 56.7% of jaguar's sales and dominating an unheard-of 66% of its market in europe (especially italy) if it weren't a great car.______________________________________on the acura transmission problems, only 16,000 cars have been afficted with the problem over the past two years, according to the posted article.  accura sells a lot of cars, so it does not seem to be a massive or wide-spread problem.  hopefully they'll fix it, but i wouldn't worry about it too much."

116,"September 23, 2002 10:52AM",jagboyxtype,"merc1-the x-type's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader, the bmw 3-series.  you may check out autoweek's review of the car for that information, as well as a review on the site autobytel.com and reviews conducted by autocar including their ""autocar book"" all about the x-type.  i never said that any of those cars you mentioned didn't have very solid and rigid structures nor did i try to imply that, but at the moment, the jaguar has the most rigid structure in its class.also, as riez would say, ""i did not write the article"".  the reviewers were the ones who said all of those quotes about the x-type beating the c-class in every part of that test, and not just acceleration times.  take braking (""top drawer"" for the x-type), or how they said the cars felt when being driven.____________________________________riez-i pity you, because you only believe what car magazines tell you, and you allow them to choose for you what is best instead of collecting your own information and actually checking things out for yourself.  listen to what you've been sayin: ""car & driver said this, and motortrend said this, and road & track said this"".  granted, i have used their quotes and stats many times to back my own opinions as well (which i even do here), but you've taken it to an extreme.""do you read mt or r&t?"" you ask me.sometimes i do, but only for entertainment purposes.  why?  because i do not trust them, do not believe everything they say, and only take what they have to say as their own human opinions.  and i am not the only one who feels that way.  abc news, for instance, did an investigation on the subject of car magazines being biased and omitting facts to suit their own interests.  they use the ford focus and car&driver and motortrend's opinions of the car as an example:""for example, in january, car and driver listed the ford focus among its '10 best cars of the year.' it never mentioned that ford had recalled the focus eight times for various problems when that review was written [one such recall was because the wheels would fall off of the car!]. also, just this month, when motor trend's review came out  no mention of the recalls or the fact that the government has five ongoing safety-related investigations of the focus. (it currently has six ongoing investigations, but only five that motor trend could have known of when it went to press.)""http://www.abcnews.comhmmm.  six government safety investigations, eight major recalls in its few years of production, and the focus is a favorite among car magazines like car&driver and motortrend.  well, they can have it, and i'm sure you think it's a wonderful little car since everything they say suddenly becomes law for you.abc also mentions how certain car manufacturers that give all-expense paid trips to reviewers get higher scores and better reviews when the reviewers handle their cars.  even an auto reviewer interviewed in the article said ""there are other subtle ways that automakers try to woo the press"".  motortrend's own c. van tune admitted to utilizing these perks from certain auto makers although his magazine has the resources to pay for these trips, etc. on its own.the warning at the end of the article reads: ""so far, the big magazines don't seem to have changed their policies. so, be aware: when you read and see reviews of this year's models, some of those reviews were written by reporters who've been fed and fueled by the car companies.""it can be expected that comparison tests would be especially succeptible to the effects of biases and perks from some automakers.  this is why you cannot believe and trust car magazines for anything more than entertainment and a very few facts.""have you even taken the time to read what european car has written? or what mt and c&d have previously written?"" you also ask me.  yes, i have.  european car's own review of the x-type is nothing short of pure flattery towards the car.  road&track's review of the x-type is also very complementary.  car&driver tested the x-type's 0 - 60 time as just 6.3 seconds and raved about ""enthusiast goods"" of the car.  motortrend enjoyed the car very much, and bought their own long-term tester, of which they say ""this new x is one shaggy jaggy"" and ""i'm anxious to try out the upcoming r version of the x-type, because this is a very good sport sedan"".  autoweek liked the car and decided that ""x"" was definitely an addition to the ""a"", ""c"", and ""3"" in the sport sedan equation.  forbes wrote a very fine review of the car.  a vast majority of other reviews, such as those at carpoint and autobytel are also complementary to the x-type.  and again, autocar was so inspired that they created a minibook about the ""most important jaguar ever"" and said that between it and a 330i, they don't know which one they would choose - ""it's that close"".you mention ""american"" tests in your posts.  i must also ask you, however, why you believe that any reviews or comparison tests about the x-type from any other parts of the world are suddenly invalid?  they are all reviews, how come only the ones you choose count?  there are people from all over the world here at edmunds, are their views and opinions also invalid to you because they do not live in the same country as you do?on the matter of that road&track 11 car comparison, the reviewers say:""so how, you ask, did a car as nice as the jaguar x-type end up second to last in this great big comparison test?  that's easy: price.""notice that they happened to also have loaded their x-type with every option available on the car including such expensive items as the navigation system, weather package, and premium sound system, etc.  yet, other cars in their test were not fully loaded as the jaguar was.  the bmw, for instance, was lacking its navigation system and other items, the mercedes-benz (the second most expensive car in the group at $44,949) also without its navigation system and lacking its premium sound system (and in fact left without a cd player that no one seems to complain about not having in this car for this price, where as the jaguar can take heat for having just a single-disc indash unit when not equipped with the 6-disc changer).  a test with price included is not valid unless all cars are optioned out with the same equipment.  the x-type had much more than any of the other cars in the test did.  a better comparison for price would have been to compare base prices of the cars or prices of options, or get this: equip the cars similarly.  take note that both the saab and the mercedes-benz have higher starting prices than the jaguar, and that the jag's starting price is about $1,500-$2,000 above most of the other cars in the test, and that it comes standard with wood and leather which costs about $1,500-$2,000 to equip on the other cars.  awd is also standard on the jag, and extra-cost options on the cars that can have it equipped.  la"

 why is it that when the x-type does win, excuses can be made for the other car(s), with ""they don't focus on those areas""?  i'm willing to invalidate the transmissions in the this test as they were not totally evenly matched there, but the x-type won out every other category of the test as well: engine, brakes, ride... i could just as easily say that the x-type doesn't focus on those areas either, but no one would back me and it really is a poor excuse.  you also note that 1/2 second is not ""stomping anything to the ground"", yet in the road&track 11-car test, the x-type was just 0.6 second slower than the fastest car in the test, and it was marked down for that.  we can't suddenly make an exception for this test.  i could say that the x-type doesn't focus on acceleration in the r&t review, but again that is a poor excuse.  if we choose to accept the r&t 11 car test, then we must, by principle, accept this test as well.  in those regards, the x-type v. c-class comparison was quite valid.take care!__________________________________riez-i think i'll terminate this discourse now that we have both had our say.  it's just going to continue in a perpetual loop if we don't stop. but...i noticed that you still say the car falls flat, and in all of those comparisons, you have said yourself that price was a major factor in the car's losing points, as well as r&t, c&d, and others noting that.  i'm just wondering if you read my really long message a ways back, as i outlined how the x-type in all of those tests was outfitted much more heavily with options than any of the other cars and that its price would have been closer to the others had the x-type been outfitted with the same options as the others in the test.  also, as merc1 notes, 1/2 second differences, etc. are not large gaps.  being 0.6 second off from the fastest car in the test, and 0.5 from the winning car is not ""falling flat"" by any means.you seem to fail to notice actual measurements and what the reviewers write about the cars, and instead only look at points and scores.  take note of the ""luggage space"" scores for the cars in the r&t 11 car test, for instance.  the x-type has a boot capacity of 16.0 cubic feet.  for that, it received 7.8 out of 10 possible points in that category.  now look at the cadillac cts with a boot capacity of 12.8 cubic feet.  yet it received 8.4 points out of the 10, and it had a smaller boot.  the infiniti g35 has 14.8 cubic feet of boot space, yet even with less space than the x-type, it received the same score of 7.8 out of 10.  the 330i, with only 10.7 cubic feet of boot space received 7.6 points, only 0.2 less point than the x-type with 5.3 more cubic feet than the 330i.  these ratios aren't right, and i cannot help but feel that their other points and scores must also be affected by these kinds of discrepancies.i also still disagree with you about european or other comparison tests not being valid.  included in these tests are cars such as the x-type, c-class, and a4, et al, that are sold in the u.s., as well as cars that are not available here.  just because a car is not u.s.-spec doesn't mean the test is totally invalid.  in those other countries especially, those tests are very valid (as far as comparison tests go).  it is not a question of whether or not the test is valid just to you, rather, it is a matter of how valid the test is as a fair test.  that's where the problem is, you are choosing which tests you want to acknowledge and which you simply feel like leaving out.  besides, the difference between a u.s.-spec car and a non-u.s.-spec car is not going to come out in the test unless the car is crash tested or has an engine choice unavailable in the u.s., etc.  you can get a general idea still, and to simply say that because it is not a test conducted by an american magazine is a bit ignorant.  especially as all of these cars are global cars.you also claim that english reviews have a bias towards british cars and that the germans also are biased.  however, i have found that those two groups especially are very picky about cars and will tear a car apart worse than any american reviewer would dare to.  the british also have a thing for bmw's - a german car - and i've not found a review where they had a bias for jaguar or any other british car, and if they were biased and i missed it, they certainly could not be any more biased than any american editors.perhaps you have not noticed the bias that american reviewers have for german and japanese cars?  i believe edmunds stated something about their ""infatuation"" with ""everything german"" in a mercedes review, and the idea that japanese cars are so much more reliable than any other cars is also overplayed to the point of now being a bias of american writers (and don't attempt to say that i'm saying that japanese cars are not reliable now, because they are, i'm simply pointing out that there is an american bias of believing that they are tremendously more reliable than any other kind of car)."
125,"September 24, 2002  1:57PM",jagboyxtype,"kdshapiro-you said ""i don't know what car you speced out but it's not my car. i don't deem a nav system a must on a fully loaded car. i am talking about leather, sport and most high end options. my 330i does not have sport, nav or xenon, but if i did it again, i might have gotten sport. to me it's fully loaded because there is nothing else i wanted and i belive the navs are the biggest waste of money anyway. if you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that's your call.""that's exactly what i was trying to prove about the x-type in its tests.  take, for instance, the road&track 11 car comparo.  the x-type had every option available including the unnecessary navigation system and other equipment that the majority of other cars did not have.  it has been that way in almost every comparison test: the editors choose a fully loaded (as in every single available option) x-type and then mark the car down for being expensive in comparison to competitors that are not fully loaded.you are totally correct, no one ever totally and fully loads out their car with every available option, but the reviewers all do for the x-type in its comparison tests.  they don't for the other cars.  even that second-most-expensive-car in the test c320 sport was still not fully loaded, it didn't even have a cd player, as i mentioned before in my other message.  in the magazines, they depict the x-type as costing $46,000 all of the time.   a base x-type 2.5 with standard connoly leather, wood trim, and manual transmission can be had at $29,000.  make the car a 3.0 litre model, and you get everything in the base model plus standard indash cd player and other goodies, and your choice of manual or automatic transmission at no extra cost, for $35,000.  nicely equipped, a 2.5 is usually around $33,000.  a nicely equipped 3.0 is around $38,000.in my other message, i wasn't trying to talk about your car.  i was using the 3-series as an example of how in the tests they'll get a nicely equipped one at $39,000 - $40,000, but that the car's fully loaded price is $45,000, just as they only showed the x-type's fully loaded price of about $46,000, when one that is nicely equipped is between $38,000 - $40,000 just like the other cars."
126,"September 24, 2002  5:28PM",kdshapiro,okay i missed the point that particular car left nothing out in the options category. most people do not buy a car like that.
127,"September 24, 2002  7:35PM",riez,"jagboyxtype...  maybe we'll have something to discourse about when ford improves the future mondeo x-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class.  as it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan.  sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat.  but i don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space.  and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges.  (oops, think i meant to say when jag improves the future x-type.    )and i'll really, really start worrying about and paying attention to european magazine results when euro-spec cars are sold here.  but today i can not even buy them.  think you should keep in mind that they often have many differences with their american counterparts (e.g., safety equipment, engines--they love diesels, transmissions) and there are tons of marques in europe that are absent in america (alfa, fiat, lancia, seat, renault, peugeout, skoda, etc.)"
128,"September 25, 2002 12:58AM",jagboyxtype,"riez-you missed the target again.  the trunk space example was simply an example of how the points awarded to certain aspects of the cars in the tests do not tell the whole truth, as you misguidedly seem to believe.  the fact of the matter is that the x-type had more boot space than the other cars i mentioned, and it recieved less points than they did and in an unbalanced ratio, and that other scoring categories were similarly affected.  you also failed to notice the phrases ""for example"" and ""for instance"" leading into what i was saying in many cases if you believe that boot space was all that i was speaking about.  you said of the x-type's large boot ""and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges.""from this i can tell that you never actually take the time to examine a car for yourself before passing judgement on it, but instead rely completely upon little comparison test articles and your own assumptions, as the x-type does have multi-link boot hinges as opposed to the swan-neck hinges on such cars as the xj8 and es300, ect. that you assumed it had, and then stated it had as if it were a fact.  but what can i expect from someone who finds himself clever at falsely mistaking a car for one with which it shares a few parts that cannot even be seen?and on that topic, in the global car world of today, every car shares parts with another or many others.  *for example* (<--if you miss it this time, i don't know what to do), bmw uses general motors-sourced automatic transmissions and parts are shared with mini.  volkswagen and audi, seat, skoda, porsche, bentley, lamborghini, and bugatti all share many <i>many parts.  daimlerchrysler and mercedes-benz share some parts now too, as well as sharing parts with hyundai and mitsubishi.  making fun of that seems, well, kind of pathetic - unless you have a weird sense of humor.  they share parts; yeah - so what?  it's not really relevant.and as i noted about reviews and comparisons from other countries, the cars do have some differences from u.s.-spec cars (as you and i had noted that engines can be different, etc.) but a general idea of the car can be had from those tests - as i had also said before in my other message.  quite often, those tests even use the versions of the cars equipped with engines that are sold with them in the u.s., as we generally have the larger versions of the engines available to us.  if it's a diesel-engine test, they usually also have the whole test based upon that fact and will call it a ""diesel showdown!"" or something else to that same effect.  again (for now the second time), you cannot simply invalidate a test because it was not conducted in america.  the cars we are disputing are not even built in america.  and many times, the versions of the cars used in the tests are for the most part equivalent to their u.s.-spec versions. alpha romeos, fiats, renaults, and vauxhalls are not sold in america, and thus i understand saying that for use in america, their tests would be for the most part inconcequential; but audis, jaguars, bmws, and mercedes are all sold in the u.s. as well as foreign countries, and those foreign versions of the cars have little difference from their u.s.-spec versions as far as any test categories can gauge.  they never crash-test the cars in these comparisons, and as c. van tune pointed out in the abc article about how reviewers are ""fed and fueled"" by certain car manufacturers, safety isn't an exciting enough category for these tests, so to those reviewers who write about them, it is irrelevant.  safety equipment is usually the primary difference between u.s.-spec and foreign versions of the same cars, but that's not going to show-up in one of these car comparisons because they are not comprehensive enough at all to measure such things.  yet it's not just foreign articles that you are saying are invalid, though.  you are just choosing the ones that back your arguement to the slightest degree, which again just a display of your ignorance.as well as the boot-hinge thing that you got wrong (remember, x-type has the multi-link hinges with auto-opening gas struts, not swan-neck hinges), you also said that it had a cramped rear seat in comparison to its competators.  in comparison to a long-wheelbase maybach, it is cramped, yes.  however, it has one of the larger rear seats in its class.  not only is it larger than the bmw 3-series' rear seat as well as the is300's and a4's, but it is also larger than the midsize 5-series' rear seat (but i'll admit not by that much compared to the 5).  in posts in other sections of the town hall, you defend how large the 5-series' rear seat is and how comfortable it is for adult passengers as far as roominess goes, why do you call the x-type's rear seat - which is even larger than the 5's - ""cramped"".  is this yet another assumption that you made about the x-type?by now i am sure that you have noticed that i have continually refered to things in this message that i have already spoken about in my other two posts addressed to you a few messages back.  i'm wondering if you really even read them since your arguements are always the same, and now you're even making outright assumptions.  no matter what i say and no matter how many facts i back my statements with, you seem to have your eyes closed to them and don't even take them into account.  not only that, but your statements are generally incorrect and your assumptions don't even touch on facts or reality.and i'd say the best selling jaguar in history is competative when it makes up 56.7% of jaguar's u.s. sales and holds an astonishing 66% of the entry-level to mid luxury segment in europe, as well as over 70% of jaguar's sales in its third largest market, italy.  was your statement about being competative just another assumption on your part?maybe we'll actually have a discussion when you start taking note of what's actually going on with the car and stop making assumptions and false remarks.  good day."
129,"September 25, 2002  6:27AM",merc1,"ok, i read all that.  so i'm supposed to believe jaguar's claim over what every other brand claims right?   until i see an independent test of all of the cars in this class structural rigidity, i'll go by what feels the most solid, and it isn't the jaguar x-type.  so we disagree there.   secondly, everyone knows full well that the c-class is not on the same plane with the 330i and is300 when it comes to being ""sporty"".   to impress me you'd have to beat those cars at all the track tests.  beating a c320 at the track isn't hard, the is300 and 330i rule there.   that acceleration test will never count in my book because of the trans difference.   i'm not saying the comparison as a whole was not valid, but i still maintain that they picked the areas in which the x-type would winout.   and lastly the x-type has been ranked below the c in every other comparo done.    if it were such a slaughter i'd think it would win some test over here too. m"
130,"September 25, 2002 12:40PM",riez,"jagboyxtype...  you should have more carefully read my post.  did i specifically mention the x-type trunk (boot)?  no, i was discussing trunks in general.  and did you notice how i was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans?  do you harp on such little things regarding the x-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors?  when you get creamed on the track and street, talk about the trunk?i don't care about sales figures.  what do they prove?  if we used that we'd all be driving a camry or accord 4-cyl sedan!as for euro-land market, keep in mind two huge facts.  currently about 40 percent of the cars sold there are diesels.  the ""hottest"" bmw is the 330id.  can i buy that in usa?  no!  and that over 80 percent of the cars sold there are manual transmission.  how many manual transmission diesel sedans, coupes, convertibles, etc. are sold in usa?  be willing to bet the figure is about zero.  ford europe and jag are rushing to get diesels into their euro-products."
131,"September 26, 2002  2:24AM",jagboyxtype,"riez-again my point was that the boot space example was an example of how the points awarded in such comparison tests do not give real data.  points and scores are skewed - or whatever adjective you would use to describe awarding more space with less points in a category that is all about having more space.""and did you notice how i was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans?""yes, i did catch that phrase the first time i read it.  however, your argument against the x-type in you message before the last was that it had a cramped rear seat and had swan-neck boot-lid hinges - both statements that were false.  and now your latest statement that you did not name the x-type directly when speaking of such things as boot-space and rear-seat room really is a weak cover-up.you stated: ""maybe we'll have something to discourse about when ford improves the future mondeo x-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class. as it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat. but i don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space. and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit usability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges. (oops, think i meant to say when jag improves the future x-type.""your argument was that you do not consider rear-seat room or trunk space when it comes to sport-sedans because those are two areas in which the x-type excels.  if it had a small boot and a cramped back seat, then you would be attacking the car for those two points!  then, to further attempt to deride the x-type, you state that large boots, such as the x-type has, often have space-intruding swan-neck hinges and odd opening shapes.  of course you did not have to ""name"" the x-type when making such statements - you implied it and did indeed name the car with the word, ""it"".  why even mention space-intruding hinges if the x-type does not have them?  also, paragraphically, your topic was about the x-type, and as those areas were spoken about there, they are directly linked to the x-type.  however, your arguments were wrong, and to counter my catching of them being wrong, you are now stating that you were not speaking of the x-type - a weak argument.  ""i don't care about sales figures. what do they prove?""you constantly say that the x-type does not compete well against its competators.  sales figures and how much of the car's manufacturer's sales the car makes are a direct indication of how well the car competes.  if the car did not compete well, then it would in turn have low sales figures and most probably not make up much of its manufacturer's sales.  the camry and accord 4-cylinder are not in the entry-level sport sedan class.  however, in their own class, it is generally accepted that they are very good cars.  also, the ratio of new buyers of a new addition to an established market segment is an indication of how well the car competes, and over 90% of x-type buyers are new customers to jaguar.  that means that it is taking sales from competators that compete in that market segment - thus it is competing very well.if you have not gotten the fact that there are european comparison tests of cars that are sold here in slightly different forms but with the same engines as u.s.-spec versions, then it is just a show of your unwillingness to be reasonable to any degree.  i have stated that those cars are not exact doubles of their u.s. versions, but the ones outfitted with gasoline engines that are available in the u.s. and other such options are so much like their american versions that a comparison test is not going to be able to differentiate the two.  if there are differences measurable by the tests, then you can take them into account.  however, to invalidate the entire test is ignorant and unreasonable.""do you harp on such little things regarding the x-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors?""no, i ""harp"" on such little things because you bring them up by making false assumptions which you present as if they were facts.  again, i used those ""little"" subjects as examples to prove my points because facts are a necessity in presenting the truth.  you are the one who decided to ""harp"" on my examples.also, as i have stated and continue to have to remind you, the x-type does not get beaten in the performance realm against competators.  examples: the x-type completely won an all-out performance test against the competing model from mercedes-benz, the c320 sport.  it is a competing car.  then, your so-very-important road&track even states: ""in acceleration, the 3.0 x-type is among the quickest.  accompanied by a nice-but-distance exhaust note, the jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer lexus is 300's and audi a4's 7.1, mercedes-benz c320's 6.8 sec. and matching the bwm 330i's time.  and remember the x-type, like the quattro, loses a tick off the line, because of a no-wheel spin launch with all-wheel-drive"".  according to your precious magazines, it also out brakes the porsche 911 gt2 from 80 mph and stops just 2 feet shorter than the 911 gt2 from 60 mph.  that is real performance and if you try to argue that down, i believe i could safely say that it is a sign of a delusional mind.perhaps you should stop simply reading my posts, but should actually begin synthesising the data as well.  i'm having a hard time responding to much of the outrageously false statements you've made thus far.you did get one thing right though.  jaguar is getting diesel engines ready for the european market as they do make up for much of a manufacturer's sales there.  that was a weak point for the x-type: it had no diesels to compete against the 330d etc. with the high gasoline prices in europe.  rest assured that when the engines are available, the x-type will compete even better than it already does so well.  and when i'm on the track, i'll remember to mention my car's boot to the porsche that i out-brake and to the is 300, a4, c320 that i out accelerate and the bmw driver that i'm dead-locked with.  even road&track took note of that."
132,"September 26, 2002  2:41AM",jagboyxtype,"merc1-other marques are not claiming that they have more rigid structures than the x-type has because they do not.  you say that you'll go by what you feel feels more solid, however, i could just say that the x-type feels more solid to me and say that the discussion is over.  either way, we cannot do that.  autoweek had the measurements for structure rigidity in their article, and i even quoted them a little way back.  they also noted that the x-type's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader's.  that means that the previous class leader no longer has the class-leading structure in rigidity because the x-type, now the class leader in structural rigidity, beats it by 30%.  you are just choosing not to accept a fact.as for the x v. c article, you say that they chose to test in areas where the x-type would win, but then wouldn't other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins?  the same can be said about any comparison.  look at what is said in these articles, point-wise, the c-class may win, however, in actual measurements, the x-type beats it.  take for instance what road&track said about acceleration, which i quoted above in my message to riez.oh well, we don't agree on this one.  at least you have an open mind enough to at least read the articles, etc.  whether you choose to believe what is said is you choice.  have a nice day."

this is the x-type section of the car crash test above:http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002take note that this is the ""jaguar x-type 2.0 lhd"" marked under the ""make, model and hand of drive"" portion of the chart at the bottom of the page.  the x-type 2.0 is the low-end europe-only version of the car that lacks the extra driveshaft that the 2.5 and 3.0 litre models have that are sold globally (as well as the driveshaft that is found in the 3-series and c-class).  thus, its crash tests produce weaker results than the 2.5 and 3.0 versions, and 3-series and c-class, because 2.0 is a fwd car with no longitudal driveshaft that is found in awd (x-type) and rwd (c-class, 3-series) cars.check out this site:http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/0210.htmit notes that the x-type underwent structural changes after december 2001 but does not say if that was a version-specific change (which i discovered it was).  a letter to consumer reports aided research, and their reply was as follows:""we spoke with jna (jaguar north america) on this question and they explained that the jaguar x-type was originally introduced in europe as a 2.0 litre fwd (front wheel drive) model. the only models sold in the u.s. are 2.5 and 3.0 liter awd versions.... that achieve better frontal crash test results than the fwd european model due to a prop shaft that runs the length of the car from front to rear. the prop to the rear supplies power to the rear wheels as well as the front, which accounts for the awd traction... the modifications made and referred to in iihs's report on x-types (made) after december 2001 were actually modifications made to fwd european models and are not applicable to the u.s. awd models.""(thanks ""jagdude"" and consumer reports for this information).also note that the reason why the c-class recieved a 5-star rating in the european test over the 4-star rating that all of the others in this class recieved was because it was the only car that had a flashing light that lit-up a sign reading the equivalent of ""fasten your seatbelt"" on its dash, which is to become a standard feature in europe in the future(?).  it would have recieved that same 4-star rating had it not had the light.  this is straight off the site:""extra points awarded for the way that the c-class reminds its passengers to buckle their seat belts have now made it the second car ever to gain a five-star crash protection rating. results for the c-class were published last year and it achieved four stars. but euro ncap has since changed its scoring system to encourage car makers to fit seat-belt warnings.""all in all, i'd feel very safe in any one of the cars in this class, and i do feel safe being in one of them.  stay safe everyone."
145,"September 29, 2002  5:58PM",linard,"i honestly cannot remember a car i've been in that hasn't had a seatbelt warning light.  our 87 mercedes 420 sel had it and my 99 honda prelude has it.  maybe this is due to european influence as the focus (originally introduced and designed in europe) has an obnoxious system that beeps and chimes if the driver does not fasten within an allotted amount of time and other cars i've been in have ""sensed"" the weight of a passenger and have flashed the seatbelt light as well (i believe the landcruiser does this).  however, as the seatbelt usage stats are dropping in the us, maybe this is a good idea after all.  i can personally attest my safety and my mother's life to seatbelts.btw jagboy, the euroncap x-type was a 2002 and it stated that the fwd 2.0 was released march of that year which is supported by both car and top gear magazines (british publications).  in addition, i am relatively certain that the x-type was introduced as an awd model to differentiate it from the mondeo and to keep it from alienating jag owners who may have cringed at the thought of a fwd jag (this is from a car article soon before the x-type itself was introduced in may of 2001).  however, as the base 2.5 is an already relatively expensive car and does not fare well against a c180 or 318i in terms of value, jag decided to introduce the fwd 2.0 with a stick as standard. from what i understand, the driveshaft does assist in distributing the crash impact rearward, however, the larger engine block of the 3.0 tends to push rearward earlier in an accident than the smaller block of the 2.0 with it's fewer driveline components (obviously as it is fwd) so the crumple zones of the 2.0 have more room to crumple.  i believe this is the reason why mercedes decided to replace the 3.2 inline 6 of the e class with the smaller block of the 3.2 v6 in 99 and the difference in crash test scores between a 97 and a 00 are pretty significant although i'm not sure if mercedes conducted any significant changes to the structure since they lowered the hood by an inch."
146,"October  1, 2002  4:28AM",jagboyxtype,"yes, my x-type also has a seatbelt warning light in the dash.  most all cars do.  in addition, it chimes at you when you do not have your seatbelt on, and it has sensors in the seats that measure how much the occupant of the seat weighs and more sensors determine how far the occupants are from the dash and steering wheel so that it can calculate how much force to use when firing airbags in the event of a collision.  a small amber light in the corner of the wood veneer on the passenger's side lights up and displays whether the occupant there weighs enough for the airbag to be automatically turned on or off, and the seats automatically also turn off the airbags if a baby or childseat is detected.
the warning system in the mercedes c-class in that test was a different light from the ones we have in our cars here.  notice that the c-class  had scored a 4-star rating in the test just as all of the other cars in that class did, but because of the addition of another light that said ""put on your seatbelt"", the car's score was later changed to a 5 to promote more lights that say ""put on your seatbelt"" to be used in other cars.  i'm not saying that the c does not deserve a high rating in crash tests, but its additional star over the other cars in its class is simply because it has an additional light that tells passengers to wear their seatbelts on top of the light on the dash that says to wear your seatbelt.  it is not necessarily safer than the other cars because of that light, and so i do not believe that it should have gotten an entire extra star for a light.you are also wrong about the 3.0 jaguar engine ""pushing"" into the cabin in a crash before the 2.5 and 2.0 because they are the same engine blocks but the 3.0 has been drilled-out more to be larger.  also, the engines do not enter the cabins at any time in a crash because the x-type is designed to ""drop"" its engine when it is in a severe frontal crash.  most modern cars do this.  x-type's engines are also mounted horizonatally, so they are not taking up a terrible amount of longitudal space in the engine bay, thus the chances of them penetrating the passenger cabin is slim in comparison to longitudally oriented engines.  again, however, the x-type drops its engine when it has a severe frontal crash, so it never enters the passenger compartment no matter what engine size is used.  the argument that a 2.0 fwd x-type would be safer than an awd larger displacement version is null and void, because the engine does not enter the cabin at any time during any impact.you really should read the bottom chart of the euroncap page for the x-type:http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002it specifically states that the car is: ""jaguar x-type 2.0 lhd.  only the fwd x-type is built with the 2.0-litre engine, which again is the same engine block as the 2.5 and 3.0, but not drilled-out as much.  all other x-types are built in awd configuration.  the awd driveshaft of the awd x-types aid in collisions v. the fwd version that is sold alongside them in europe against 318 and c180.mercedes-benz decided to changed to a v6 from an i6 because they lowered the bonnet of the e-class between those configurations and could not fit the i-6 under the lowered bonnet, as well as because it may have cost less to produce and it could be used in more vahicles as it had better packaging.  that is also the reason for the discontinuation of the e300 diesel, as the diesel engine could not fit under the lowered bonnet that was used when the v6 was introduced (that and because the e300 did not sell well here).  the e-class should have been designed to drop its engine in a crash as well.  i've not heard of a modern car being designed so that its engine penetrates the passenger compartment in a collision."
147,"October  1, 2002 11:37PM",linard,"while the c-class did gain an extra star because ncap changed it's guidelines earlier this year on performance in crashes and safety features provided, the c class did earn it's full 5 stars as it's a very well designed car collision-wise, when i can find the article in which ncap justified giving the c class an extra star b/c of it's overall performance, i'll paste the link.  as the pre 2003 e class also includes this seatbelt light, your logic would conclude that it too, should receive 5 stars from it's previous 4 when it doesn't.  the fact that car engines are not designed to go into the passenger compartment is obvious, what isn't as obvious is while the x-type is designed to, as you describe, drop it's engine and driveline components, they will always ""push"" into the compartment as evidenced by the insurance institute's listing of the crash details in which the x-type exhibited moderate footwell intrusion, between 8 to 12 cm.  the best rated c class, on the other hand, had intrusion measures of 2 to 3 cm.  engineers are constantly trying to limit this phenomenon.  while i don't doubt the driveshaft aids in crash test scores, i wasn't trying to prove one way or another, i was speculating on a possible alternative.  and while i may be wrong on the engine block of the 2.0 being different from the 2.5 and the 3.0, i am certain that the e class' hood and front fender structures were lowered as a result of the new engine's newfound underhood space, and not due to the new engines being introduced b/c of the lowered hoodline.  this is evidenced by the 99 e320 having the v6 with the prefacelifted hoodline.  the discontinuation of the e300 in the u.ss was caused by the low demand for that particular car and b/c of the structural change.  however, that never meant that mercedes dropped diesels from it's complete linup, in fact, europe still has the option of a few remarkable diesel e class engines which mercedes could have introduced here along with the redesigned 2000 e class."

150,"October  2, 2002  7:33AM",wishnhigh1,"i have seen 3 mercedes cars in accidents where the cars were totalled, two of which were rollover accidents. one of the rollover accidents was an s430, and it had a mild cabin protrusion, but nothing serious. the cabin was in perfect shape basically. the other was i believe a 600sel. this one was extremely important because even though this car had pillarless windows, the roof of the car did not cave in at all, even though the car came to a rest upside down. the guy was still in the car at the time, and he was hanging upside down, with no visual bruises, and a few minor cuts from broken glass. the third accident was an e320 which was involved in a head on collision with a camaro, who was racing another camaro on a 2 lane road. i didnt see the drivers, but i saw the car as it was being towed away, and again, no cabin protrusion at all. the car was completely destroyed up to the point where the footwell started. im generally dont praise late model mercedes', but i will always say glamorous things about them when it comes to safety. in my opinion, they are a few steps above volvo. they also have some of the strongest roof structures short of a 3"" thick roll bar."
151,"October  2, 2002 10:38AM",sphinx99,"i'll say it up front, i don't think edmunds does a consistent job on sedan reviews.  i understand the whole ""they're in bmw's payroll"" thing as well as the ""but we're not"" thing.  this month's letters to the editors & edmunds' responses make good points on both sides.unfortunately, edmunds does a fabulous job of putting numbers to their words that later can be dug up and compared.  i'm specifically looking at the entry level luxury sedan comparos - 2001 where a tl-s edged out a 330i, then 2002 where a 330i wiped the floor with the competition.  the idea (and some will agree while others disagree) is that the scores tended to deliberately put bmw above the acura.is this happening?  well, i decided to look at the numbers behind the comparisons to find out.  given identical cars, whereas the two were eventually matched on performance in 2001, now there is a 20 point spread between them in 2002.  what, acura got slower or bmw got faster?  given identical front seat comfort in 2001, now for 2002 bmw front seat comfort is tops while acura's is bottom.  did the seats actually change, or did the editors of the 2002 review have smaller rumps?not that only acura gets the shaft either.  in 2001 bmw got a higher ""feature content"" rating than the tl-s.  in 2002, a 330i with more features than the 2001 model only tied the feature content rating than a tl-s with the same features.  this in spite of the fact that features the 330i lacked in 2001 (dual zone climate control, indash cd changer) were simply left off the top 10 features list in 2002, leaving bmw as a vehicle that offers every top 10 feature as either standard or optional.basically, i like the prose of the articles and take away many good things from reading them.  when i look at the rankings, though, they seem to be statistically invalid; if, twelve months later, your opinions on identical seats can change that much, then how can you rank these cars based on 1% differences in the final rankings?in one of the comparos, it was stated that the margin for error was about 0.5%, and any two cars tallying numbers within .5% of each other would be considered tied.  i suggest increasing that buffer to 10% in order to account for the startling differences you find between two cars after just one year.until then, i'm going to stop reading into the numbers and ranking, and concentrate on the prose and photographs.  we spend a great deal of effort arguing here about which sedan came in #1 and which one came in #2.  if you look at the numbers used to actually rank these vehicles against each other, they fluctuate so wildly from one set of editors to another (you'd think that using a set of editors would even out the fluctuation) so as to make the ranking of these vehicles practically worthless.front seat comfort2001: acura 83, bmw 832002: bmw 9.2, acura 7.6rear seat comfort2001: bmw 74 acura 702002: acura 9.2 bmw 5.8conclusion: either bmw and acura received total redesigns in 2002 unbeknownst to all of us, or the editor butt-o-meter does not produce repeatable results."

182,"September 27, 2003  6:09PM",riez,"cjs2002...  since you'll only go automatic transmission, i would not recommend the following combinations as they are sluggish in comparison to alternatives within the marque or the up-engined model:325i auto (esp. heavier awd version)tsx auto (uses small 2.4l i4 that needs high rpms for power)a4 1.8t auto (esp. heavier awd version)x-type 2.5 auto (made heavier by standard awd)mb c230 (esp. heavier awd version)noticed you left one car off your comments:  lexus is300.  you should take one for a spin.  my wife loves her is300 automatic.    if you are considering the cadillac cts, you should also look at the lincoln ls6.  lincoln dealers are really discounting these fine cars.  most cts' i've seen at two local cadillac dealers tend to be loaded up with $5-7k worth of options.  hard to find one near $30k.  if you want powerful car and don't mind fwd, you might consider acura 3.2tl, infiniti i35, nissan maxima se, or nissan altima 3.5se.jag s-type is not normally considered ""near luxury"".  thinking its base price starts in the low $40,000s and quickly moves up with options.  if you can afford this, you might consider bmw 5 series (525i or 530i) or lexus gs300."

211,"November  7, 2003  6:34PM",chrisboth,"the volvo is fast off the line - but imo its a turbo vs na thing which i believe all else equal you take the na.  people who ahve driven the volvo have said that it's very fast but not quite a sports sedan and doesn't feel as planted as a g or 3.to mod the g you can do a ton with the work the guys owning 350z have done - since the underpinnings are the same as the g the g guys do what the z guys innovate. cold air intake, pulleys, light flywheel, grounding kit, intake plenum upgrade, cams are available, headers, catbacks and true duals are almost availble.  ecu upgrades to raise redline and improve mods where the ecu retard them by defaukt are available as well.ps a guy with exhaust intake and plenum upgrade with a ecu flash got a 14.1 in an auto sedan.  i think you could get to 13.9 with all the above.  na babysome or many of these may add up to a couple grand but its fun for me over time to do most of these things.  much more mods i think the m3 was good for and plenty more to come.  there are some serious enthusiast in g forums out there too.  check em out"

(i've tried both cars plus the is300 and the rx-8). i was almost sold on the g35 until i read about its brake and cd players problems. plus people are not pleased with infiniti's service.i guess now i have no option, b/c the only comparable car to a g35 (bmw 330i w/ performance  package--a must. otherwise it's too slow.) is too much $$$. after receiving excellent service from both honda and saab, i have no interest in getting crap from any service dept./dealer. i mean, saab gives you a loaner even if you are getting an oil change! and they just finished replacing the entire 200 watt harmon kardon sound system on my 9-5 because one speaker was fried (which was me playing the music too loud, not a defect).  i definitely do not want to downgrade either in car quality (my 9-5 has been perfect) or service.however, i just did some research on lexis and and infiniti is rated very high by jd power and associates.for initial quality for the 2003 model year:1. lexus2. cadillac3. infiniti8. bmw11. honda14. benz29. mazda32. saabfor dependability in 2003 (this rated vehicles of the 2000 model year after 3 years):1. lexus2. infiniti13. bmw12. saab26. benzfor 1998 models after 4 years:1. lexus2. infiniti10. bmw16. benz19. saabyet the bottom line seems to be that even tho infiniti sells great cars, it has never developed the cachet of lexus, much less bmw, etc. so it is desperate to sell cars. it is trying to rebuild its line (and nissan) out of the slump brought on by the weak yen and the success of lexus. of course, the problem is that it seems to be caring more about getting customers than keeping customers.unless i get this car for below invoice, i won't take the chance on crappy product or service.am i right?"
215,"November 12, 2003  4:05PM",bimmer97,"i think the s60r is nice inside , has soft leather all around, infiniti has more hard plastic. imo orange gauges look horrible in g35 while volvo has cool looking blue. clutch is stiffer in g35, volvo has a light but spring loaded feel. the shifter of the g  vibrates and  takes a lot to get used to when shifting into reverse (far right and downward motion) volvo  doesn't vibrate and shifts into reverse more normally( what i'm used to)both look good but have totally different looks g 35 has that japanesse looks  whiel volvo has a more sedated euro look. volvo steering feels looser at low parking lot speeds but tightens up when speed is increased.   g-35 feels a little tight. both stick to the road and both seemed like they stop pretty well.  i did not feel tubro lag and s60 had pop when accelating. s60 is awd and weighs more(don't need awd in fla) i think the s60 is a little faster and hold  a little better big 18"" wheels w p zero's.so my delema is which one do i get. what will hold up betterin the long term. s60r is awd which i guess is nice but really isn't needed in fla.   one is more expensive but is damm good both in and out. one is cheaper looks better out then in.i think the g35 sedan wont hold value as well as the s60r because they will be produced  in greater quanity.any opinions would be appreciated."

220,"November 12, 2003  7:56PM",kdshapiro,if you want to acquire a car you have to go to the dealers and negotiate a deal. bmws have had historically very high residuals while infiniti has had historically low residuals. nothing i have seen or heard of has changed this. but you have to be willing to go toe-to-toe witht he dealer to get the best deal.
221,"November 12, 2003  7:57PM",chrisboth,is just that history.  residuals change all the time - get the facts before you decide based on a forum with old information.ps there is no negotiating the resiudual. it is what the bank tells you it is and no car dealer can change it

225,"November 12, 2003 10:26PM",kdshapiro,most people buy blue chip stocks based on past history. i don't anyone who throws out a blue chip stock because they had a bad quarter. usually look at the bigger picture. the same with lease residuals. the reason they are high for bmw is historically people are willing to pay a good dollar for bmw used vehicles.
226,"November 13, 2003  2:31PM",chrisboth,there is no fluffy big picture to a quantitatively defined lease residual.  the g coupe gets best in class in kiplinger's december personal finance issue.  bmw get some nice comments as well but right now - the only thing that matters is what the math works out to be on a deal done today.  by virtue of today's lease residuals it costs less to buy g coupea as opposed to a 330ci ~ all else equal.you're not wrong to say that people have historically paid more for used bimmers e it's true.  now the reality is people will pay the most for a g coupe of any car out there.  infiniti has had great cars for thier entire existence and now the market has bidded up one car int he lineup to reflect this.  bmw manages it's used car markets better than anyone and perhaps nissan learned something.  history is nice but inadequate in most cases to accurately determine future trends.  people who look backwards only in portfolio management get fired.  in fact the real finds are in places where history has not been so kind.
227,"November 13, 2003  2:55PM",kdshapiro,"history is generally the only accepted principal in the financial markets. i'm not sure why you say it isn't. you are correct, lease residuals are enforce for a deal done in this specific minute. they can change in one day. but kiplingers doesn't make the market, they report the financial news and again the reason bmw lease residuals are typically high is due to the overall demand of used/cpo vehicles.check this link for a comparision between bmw/audi/infinity:car_man ""lease questions - ask here"" oct 7, 2003 7:19am!keywords=allin:msgtext%20limit:.ee9394d%20g35"

""read the article.  the bank buys the residual info from some one who analyzes the market.  if not kiplinger then who.  even if they are reporting the facts only...you can say you've seen this change.re the financial discussion perhaps we should take it elsewhere.  the only fundamental principal held by chartered financial analysts, the highest designation for institutional money managers is having a basis for representing to a client that an invstment is suitable based on his needs.  this specifically has to based on forward looking fundamentals.  reversion to the mean priciples suggests that what has done well in the past will not in the future and vice versa.history is about the last place you can justify an investment to a board a judge or the disciplinary body that can revoke the charter. any one in money magagemnt - not a broker - will tell you history only serves to put a company on the radar for your selection process.  if you want to read up on this type ""modern porfolio theory"" into google"

232,"November 13, 2003  4:28PM",chrisboth,and if they set it too high they lose thier job or business.  predicting values 3-5 years out is an art and setting them this high has to be based on great market percpetion and actual values obtained in used car markets.  you get stuck with 66% of a car you have to be able to make money on it still.  apparently institutions belive the g is the best coupe out here based on available and recently changed residuals.

237,"December  1, 2003  3:15AM",georgi1,"speedracer, you are right. in cases where companies offer higher residuals they would demand high interest (or money factors, if you'd prefer). in my experience the manufacturer's own financial company usually gives the higher residuals. however, beware that even though the monthly payments of high-res/high-mf & low-res/low-mf come out the same, if you decide to buy the vehicle at lease-end you would have to pay more for the higher residual. personally, i've found the residual values on cars.com to better reflect what i see on used-car listings."

290,"January  4, 2004 10:24AM",zumbalak,"i saw the arguments about the tl and the 330. it is all about the buyer's choice. i love my 03 m3 and i also love my 03 g35. they are imho exceptional cars for the price i paid. i believe m3 handling can not be easily matched with a car in the same price range, except the corvette. g35 is also an excellent car and handles almost as good as the 330, i got the g because i didn't want another bmw 3 series. the car is exceptional when it comes to performance and the looks, many people talk to me about the car in parking lots and gas stations. meanwhile an m3 is as we know m3.i recently test drove the tl (actually borrowed it from the dealer - manager is my friend) and there was so much hype about the car, so i got it for a couple of hours (their demo) drove around the town. and i was quite impressed, it is a way better car than the old tl. but the hype in my opinion is not well worth.the sound system works excellent if you actually have a dvd audio disc (they had one that was sent from the factory i think) and it is just excellent quality. but when you put a regular cd it is nothing ordinary. the performance, it has excellent pick up, but the fwd downgrades the potential of this car. whatever others say, there is the torque steer, this car would have been excellent as an rwd, and i think as far as the pick up (in street start the g will beat the tl, well we know m3 performance is something else)the interior is good quality but does not match the refinement of the bmw 3 series or the audi or the mb, but better than the g. the interior space was less than the g along with the trunk space. i guess the g is a larger car overall and that makes a lot of difference, especially for me with a family and lots of people in the car at all times. i think interior space is similar to 3 series sedan. i am 6'3"" and with my seating position there was almost no space at the back of the driver's seat (a similarity to the 3 sedan)the handling of the car is not as refined as the 3 or the g. i realized this when i was entering a highway ramp at about 60-65 mph, and felt the need to hold the steering wheel with both hands very steady because the car almost got out of the road. it was a scary moment, and such wouldn't happen with a rwd 3 series or the g or the quattro audi. the handling is of course no issue in straight roads, but not everybody drives crazy like me in the backroads. i would prefer an audi quattro, 3 series or the g for backroads, mountain roads, but definitely not a tl. the car just didn't make me feel comfortable enough, kind of made me scared in a couple of situations.the looks are not so much in my style, it feels so dull and very accord like. it doesn't have a unique feeling of itself. i think they should have worked on the looks a little bit longer.overall the tl is an excellent value for an ordinary daily driver. it offers so much for so less, good interior, good performance, good safety features, and a low msrp.but for those who don't mind spending the extra cash i know that many will opt for other vehicles. acura tl in my opinion is the choice for first time near-luxo car buyers who do not have the ability of spending another 5k without worrying about their pockets.i am looking forward to the new vette and most likely i will be the first in line to add the car into my garage. and then maybe trade in the g for the 05 audi a6 quattro.meanwhile the argument of bmw is better than tl better than mb better than g better than this that can go on forever. but one need to know that everybody has a different budget, and different reason for buying a car. some people may not mind spending 40k, some people may only afford 34k some can not even afford that and some go out and buy a ferrari for 200k. instead of comparing i think it is best to drive the car and enjoy the purchase. i honestly did not see a ferrari owner and a lamborghini owner fighting and arguing about their cars and try to prove one is better than the other.because they just don't care much, they enjoy th"

293,"January  4, 2004  4:17PM",riez,"for those who love numbers, compare performance and price numbers for cars like the neon srt-4 and sentra se-r spec v.  ensure you add the available performance options like lsd to srt-4 and the brembo brake package to the spec v.  then compare these cars, which cost around $20,000, to the 330i or tl.  that srt-4 will run (run over?) the tl or 330i and save you a small fortune in the process.  but is it a legitimate comparison?price to performance is not the only way to go nor even always a relevant comparison."

299,"January  4, 2004  7:18PM",saugatak,"think that's a topic for another board, but i don't think anyone can argue that v6 camry or v6 accord (will refer to them as camcord from now on) give you best bang for buck.  yes, you can get a lower brand car but the camcord is renowned for its reliability and low gas mileage and due to its reliability has a low total cost of ownership (tco).with respect to the price differential between a nav-accord and a nav-tl, i agree the nav-accord wins in the value equation, but from what i've read (somebody with more exp. with both systems please help me out) the acura's nav system is a lot better.  i have not bought any nav systems in my cars to this point (i find a $20 map/atlas that i can carry from car to car is a pretty unbeatable value) so i don't know this for sure, but my understanding is that the nav system on the tl allows you to say ""phone home"" and then the car will dial the number for you, whereas this is not possible on the nav-equipped accord.now this may seem silly to you but i kind of dig this feature a lot for 3 reasons:1)  i never use a cell phone when driving (unless i'm stuck in traffic and need to tell someone i'll be late) because it's dangerous so to be able to make voice-activated calls is incredibly useful.  time is money and if i can conduct some business while on the phone and save some time, the nav system on the tl could pay for itself.  also, if you must talk on the phone, this is a much safer way to do it and could save your life, which is definitely worth something.2)  one of my favorite shows as a kid was knight rider (in spite of david hasselhoff) because the talking corvette with the roving cylon eye was just so cool.  there is a fun factor in talking to your car and getting a response back that is hard to quantify.3)  if i buy the tl, it'll be the 6mt so with a stick in right hand  and wheel in left hand, voice-activated calling is really more than a luxury, it's almost a necessity.the point is although objectively the nav-accord beats the nav-tl, i think there are some good reasons to spring the extra $ for the superior acura nav./voice system.with respect to the current generation v6 accords, i found that honda took all the driving fun out of the current gen. accord.  to me, they have the driving feel of a camry and frankly, the camry is a better camry than the accord is.  when you compare prices on the non-nav accord v6 and non-nav tl, i think the price difference is only $3,700 (based on my market research that i could get the accord for $600 over invoice and the tl for $2k under msrp based on what's been posted on the prices paid boards).i think the extra $3,700 is money well spent to upgrade from non-nav accord to non-nav tl.  also, i really want a 6mt and unfortunately the accord sedan does not come in 6mt and v6.  i'd have to get the accord 6mt v6 coupe.and my wife's response when i suggested that we save some cash on my car by me getting the accord 6mt coupe was:  ""i always sit in the front and you are responsible for putting son in the back seat and pulling him out of the back seat.""well i like to save money like the next guy, but destroying my back is not the way i'm gonna do it so it's the tl for me."
300,"January  4, 2004  7:31PM",saugatak,"i don't normally defend kdshapiro, but i really think that his basic point that ""value is in the eyes of the beholder"" is correct.it's kind of hard to compare the tl to any bmw b/c pricewise it's closer to the 3-series but sizewise it's comparable to the 5-series.if you are someone who places a high premium on being able to hit 270 degree exit ramps at 65 and really enjoys driving your car beyond 8/10ths on twisty roads, there really is just one sedan out there for you and that's bmw.  also as someone who drove a 3-series in his 20s, i have to say that i had a much, much easier time picking up hot girls with that car than any other car i've had before or since.i think if you exclude the 2 factors i mentioned above, the tl whomps the bmw 3-series, but getting hot girls with minimal efforts is, as they say in the mastercard commercial, priceless.ok, i think most of the people on these boards are men and hopefully i haven't offended any women."

321,"January  5, 2004  1:43PM",riez,"as with price and performance, this is subjective.  which i have repeatedly stressed.  for me, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" automatic.  and the performance and fun-to-drive factor of even a ferrari automatic pails in comparison to the same experience with a manual.and keep in mind that smg-type systems (used by ferrari, maserati, bmw, aston martin, etc.) are not automatics.  they are manual transmissions with software and systems to allow an automatic mode but still don't have a torque converter.  and, yes, cars as expensive as the new mb mclaren are still not true performance cars.  what is up with a hyper expensive ""supercar"" with a 5-speed mb automatic transmission?  even autoweek ran a poll on this issue.shenkar...  i stand by my subjective opinion.  a ferrari with an automatic transmission is a travesty, one reflected in the future resale market.  it is less than what a ferrari could and should be.kahunah...  and your 270 hp tl fwder will also out torque steer my car.  too much weight over front wheels which are also drive wheels.  fwders can never escape the laws of physics.pg48477...  the is300 sedan is about 54/46.  the sportcross (wagon) is about 53/47.  not 50/50 but certainly not 60/40.

325,"January  5, 2004  7:27PM",fedlawman,"your assertion that a car must be rwd to be a ""true"" sports car is preposterous.compare the is300 to the mazda 6s. both cars are within a hair of each other in hp, tq, 0-60 and 1/4 mile acceleration, skidpad grip, slalom speed, and braking distances.even the weight distribution is close (54/46 vs. 59/41). yes, dynamically fwd and rwd perform differently. from a standing start, the is300 has an advantage over the mazda 6 because it has better traction to the drive wheels. on a racetrack however, that advantage is gone, as it simply requires a different driving technique (line) to make a fwd go fast vs. a rwd. basically, going around a road course quickly involves three elements - power-to-weight ratio, braking performance, and traction. in corners, traction is key because the more you have, the more power you can put down on the pavement. the factor that most affects traction is weight transfer, which is why smoothness is so important for fast lap times. compared to a fwd car, in a rwd car, turn-in happens sooner because during braking (entry), weight shifts away from the drive wheels, and the resulting loss of traction can cause oversteer. since turn-in is earlier, the apex also comes sooner, causing the line to straighten and allow the driver to begin accelerating. this technique obviously won't work well in a fwd car because the ""wrong wheels"" need the traction to exit the corner. therefore, weight transfer through a corner must be managed differently for a fwd car.if you're piloting a fwd car into a corner, you adjust your line by braking and turning-in later. this adjusts the line by moving the apex out farther. with a later apex, the fwd'er straightens the line through the turn and can accelerate harder, sooner.it may not seem as natural to you, but it is no less effective at producing fast lap times.as far as torque steer is concerned - no it's not fun, but modern high performance fwd cars (like the mazda 6 or acura tl) have it managed very well, so if it's present at all, it's more of a distraction than a performance handcap.of course, all of this talk is moot on the street. at 8/10ths, it rarely comes into play.for the most fun and biggest performance gains, attend a driving school and put good rubber on your wheels."

328,"January  5, 2004 10:52PM",fedlawman,"i haven't driven the tl so i cannot comment on its torque steer. i do admit that 270 hp is a lot to send to the front wheels...that said, while i don't believe fwd takes away from the fun to be had driving the tl, i do suspect that its 3700# curb weight makes it more of a grand tourer than a canyon carver. i would take a tsx over the tl any day...and in fact, i did!"
329,"January  6, 2004 12:23AM",chrisboth,"acura rocks in many ways - the tl is a sweet ride but it is not a sports sedan at 85-95% of the envelope - while it may perform in curves nearly as well - hell even as well - better? possibly with aspec, it won't feel as competently done. that late turn in the fwd offers is kinda neat and i enjoyed it in the acura's i've owned and driven but the rumbling torque steer  over bumps or uneven pavement is a very unimpressive offering for you and your passengers in a heavy car even.  the tsx may be the best value for that market segment ever.  it's very much like the tl in terms of appearance and stance...tsx owners must love it!  and not vice versa"
330,"January  6, 2004 12:45AM",riez,"fedlawman... please review the earlier recent posts.  as i said, i am not talking smooth test track performance.  heck, using that criteria a fwder with a live rear axle can be quite the performer.  i'm talking on the real roads i drive every day.  on the twisties.  on the curves.  on the bumps.  (you really appreciate irs when you are taking a nice sweeper fast and you hit a bump.  when you lack irs the entire rear bounces up in the air and you say a silent prayer.  not unlike torque steer!) today i had fun ""playing"" with my business fwd sonata (v6, 5-speed manual with defeatable traction control) in the snow and ice.  she tugs and pulls like crazy every time she loses traction.  all that weight over the front wheels and those drive wheels trying to steer at the same time they fight for traction.  you fight to steer her.  just take a corner as you lose some front wheel traction.  pulls left then right.  laws of physics.  that is true for every fwder i've ever driven hard.  (and, yeah, i had fun driving '01 tl type s but she torque steered.  same for the i35 sport i drove.)  only way to go is to ensure the drive wheels are not the steering wheels!  don't forget that 5% of 3,000 pounds is 150 pounds.  fwder is like having your pre-teen sitting on your hood all the time."
331,"January  6, 2004 12:47AM",saugatak,"fwd vs rwd has been debated to death.  my personal take is that the difference is overrated.mb makes rwd vehicles but how well do they handle?  every mb i've ever driven has been a nice car but handling wasn not really its strongest characteristic.lexus makes both fwd and rwd cars, but aside from riez's favorite is300 (lol, he has 2 of 'em), i would really have to focus very hard to tell the difference in the drivetrain.  a soft plushy ride completely divorced from any feel for the road sucks whether the drivetrain is a fwd or rwd.if you really want to make a performance car, you not only have to have the rwd but you need to do all the other things it takes to get the weight balance as close to 50-50.  not sure what the exact weight balance on the is300 is riez, but it doesn't sound anywhere close to 50-50, so on that basis infiniti g35 and bmw are going to be a lot better than is300.also, i think if you are used to a rwd and then go to a fwd, the difference is really noticeable so you tend to overemphasize it.  the opposite is also true.for example, i'm now used to my mdx and when i had to drive an ml320, it took me a while to get used to the turns.  once i got used to it in 5 mins. it was fine.i find that as long as i have some feel for the road, i can get used to just about any car and drive with my normal skill level, and after a while don't notice it unless i try to go above 7/10ths.living in the ne, i prefer fwd b/c i can slap on all seasons and not worry about snow tires.  yes, you can get a rwd/awd sedan, but those are a lot heavier, so their performance is compromised and they eat up a lot more gas.when i move to ca, where bad weather isn't as much of a problem, i'd give a lot more consideration to rwd, but i'm not going to let the drivetrain alone influence my decision as to which car i want."

(i don't know first hand) i'd rather be listening to an ml anyday. if i can't do that, i'd rather drive the bimmer.  anyway since we're talking about unused capabilities, why don't you drive a honda accord and save yourself $7k, if you are sitting in traffic. you have unused capabilities, especially with the inbound toronto traffic in the morning.$4k for a good aftermarket stereo along with a honda could still save you money over a tl."

470,"January  9, 2004 10:34AM",cybersol,"well, first of all, horsepower has little to do with acceleration, its all about top speed. acceleration is about torque, and not just peak torque, but the whole area under the torque curve. the tl achieves 238 lb.ft. @ 5000 rpm while the bmw achieves 214 lb.ft. @ 3500 rpm. so there is only 24 lb. ft. of difference in the peak torque, but the bmw acheives it much earlier. an earlier torque peak generally means a much broader and flatter torque curve in general (less peaky). it also generally means less peak hp, which explains the large hp difference.and second of all, the engine is not alone, power is tramsitted to the ground via the gearing of the transmission and the final drive axle. gear spacing affects acceleration by allowing the engine to stay longer between its peak torque and peak hp. the first gear ratio also needs to be selected so as to deliver maximum power without overpowering the wheels and tires that will deliver the force to the ground.all that being said, i listed the bmw, g35, and tl because they are approximately equal in all the acceleration testing i have seen. there seems to be just as large a variation in the times of different g35s, for instance, as there is a variation between the three different models."
471,"January  9, 2004  1:02PM",riez,"the rx is based on the camry.the is300's ""lowish"" highway fuel economy estimate is due to its gearing.  it does not use a very deep overdrive 5th gear.  i'd prefer a deeper overdrive, but you hardly have to shift out of 5th in order to pass.  the is300 is performance car, not an economy car.  designed for drivers who even want performance in 5th gear? just compare the gearing in the camry and rx versus the is300 (taking into account both final drive ratio and the individual ratio of each gear).if you want to complain, check out the mileage differences between the 325i and 330i.  the less powerful 325i isn't very fuel efficient.  and part of that problem is tied to its gearing (as well as a smallish engine for the car's weight)."

548,"January 27, 2004  7:35PM",danny1878,"anyway there is no exact comparo between g35, 330, tl, 540. 3.5l engine vs 3.0l engine vs 3.2l engine vs 4.0l engine. all car are good. depends on who drive it. i used to race a bike yamaha 250cc but since the accident, i would think twice about going all out. lets drive safe guys."
549,"January 27, 2004  7:44PM",raher,"chris..it appears to me you are the one posting that the g can't be beat but don't have any facts to back it up other than it is your opinion because you really like your car. everyone gets left behind by someone. i am still not convinced that the g is going to consistently leave the other sedans behind since the data isn't out there yet to back up your opinion. that's what those multi car shootouts do. what will you do when you eventually lose one of those stoplight races because your reaction time was a little slow ? yell at them that the g 35 is faster but the driver isn't ? there really isn't any point to continue to chant the g 35 mantra since you are the only one who appears to believe it. i am willing to admit that they are all nice cars and  have different strengths and weaknesses. i am not willing to admit that any of the sedans being discussed is a clear cut winner over the others.as to the vq being the most ""respected""  engine in the $30k class...respected by who..the owner of the car ? respect isn't something i give to inanimate objects, respect is for people. all i hear is a bunch of bench racing."

587,"January 29, 2004  3:03AM",rderizans,"fwiw, i've read the posts over the last few days with some amusement.  what a great world we live in if you've got 30-40k to spend on a car, huh?  bmw, audi, infiniti, acura, caddy...whatever, things just keep getting better, huh?i just traded my 99 328i (e46) for a g35x.  i absolutely loved the 328i, but the abs pump went and i figured the $2500 repair price was a good excuse to go shopping.  before that, the car was rock-solid.  never a problem, really.the g35x was just the best value for me out there.  it's beautiful (imho, of course), has awd, and a great engine (with more power, but not as smooth-revving as my bmw), while also giving me more room than my bmw.  oh, and it was about $6k less than the comparable 3-series today (330ix), although i don't think the $6k is all prestige - there's definitely something special about a 3.i test-drove the acura tl and it's a pretty amazing bargain.  didn't care for the fwd feel or the dealers in my area or i'd probably be driving one today.  interior is amazing.  puts infiniti and bmw to shame.  during my test drives, for what it's worth, the engine didn't feel as good as the g35's, but a test drive isn't a great place to evaluate such things.  cars need about several thousand miles on them before the engines loosen up.anyway, the bmw (with sport and summer tires)felt lighter and more agile than my new g35x, but the g35x feels more powerful and rides better.  both are awesome cars.one other note about all of the posted ""tests"" from magazines.  i love reading about cars, but the comparos really are sometimes apples to oranges.  for example, bmws are always tested with the sport package and summer tires (usually pilots). most other cars are tested with all-season tires.  mention is rarely made of that difference.  it certainly must account for some of the skidpad and steering response results.  in bmw's defense, they have the guts to put top-flite performance tires on their cars so they should get credit...not like the crap turanza el42s that came on my g35x.anyhow, my overall point is that after having owned a bmw 3 for over five years and extensively test driving an audi a4, acura tl, and g35x, i can say that i honestly think i could have been incredibly happy with any of these four cars.  if caddy can get their build-quality up i'm sure they will be another player.  for those who don't think there's something special about a 3-series bmw, you really need to own one for a while.  i fell in love and might very well find myself back in a bmw down the line.  the g35x is a different and amazing car, though, and for me, it's the best of what's out there today.  heck, even if you're looking in the 25k range you have the passat, mazda6, accord, altima, and camry!whatever you choose in whichever class, what a great time to be car shopping!!!"

717,"February  5, 2004  6:29PM",riez,"jrock65... those are purely ""guestimates"". the actual numbers won't be know for years when real owners go to sell their cars or trade them in.  the industry has done a horrible job projecting depreciation (which impacts both leases and non-lease purchases) for the past decade or more.  trend had been to inflate.  plus manufacturers sometimes artificially inflate residual in order to subsidize the lease.  then they take a bath 3 years down road when their dealers are wholesaling the lease returns.realized depreciation really best applies to the person who buys the car new and then sells it later.  their actual realized depreciation is the difference between what they actually paid (which is usually below msrp) and what they actual get for resale (which is usually below the published books).  msrp is normally meaningless to depreciation unless that is the price paid at time of purchase."

719,"February  5, 2004  7:03PM",riez,"guess it really depends on whether you plan on leasing or buying and how long you plan on keeping the car.  these guestimates won't matter a whit if you buy the car outright, keep it for a decade, and drive the wheels off of it.  nor will they matter if you are leasing and get a great subsidized lease deal from the manufacturer, where they deliberately over-estimate residuals in order to lower less payment.of course, these estimates do matter when it comes to calculating a lease deal today.  but i've never leased and can't imagine ever doing so.but i also think these estimates can be dangerous for people who buy and then plan on trading in or selling off their car in say 2-5 years. these numbers are almost always over what you will actually receive from a dealer or private party.  to be safe, deduct at least an extra 10% if not more like 25%.give you an example.  on 11/30/01 i bought a cpo '98 540i6.  had about 52k miles.  original msrp was around $58k.  i paid about $36k.  i traded her in 9/03 at about 78k miles.  got about $19k from dealer.  so my actual depreciation for the 22 months and 26k miles i owned her was about $17k.  the dealer who bought it from me sold it for about $22k.  so the car at 78k miles/5 years was worth a bit over a 1/3 what she went for new/actually paid in '98."

754,"February 12, 2004  3:10AM",jmess,boy they sure hit the back portions of the g35 wagon with the ugly stick.
755,"February 12, 2004  5:03AM",kahunah,oh my! they can't be serious. the m35 looks...interesting. : /
756,"February 12, 2004  5:09AM",danny1878,"omg, oh no it's a bird, oh no it's a plane oops its a coffin.lets hope that the car has a cloaking device installed"
757,"February 12, 2004  6:41AM",blueguydotcom,"anything you see on hollywood extra is utter bunk.  some guy set up that site years ago and he's been wandering around since posting doctored photos and such as insider info.  it's bunk, move on."
758,"February 12, 2004 10:54AM",jrock65,"g35 coupe outsold 325ci + 325ci convertible + 330ci + 330ci convertible by 2100 to 1500 in january '04.  however, i assume that january is not a popular month for convertible sales.any word as to whether nissan will build a g35 convertible?"
759,"February 12, 2004  1:58PM",qbrozen,"yeah, they increased the interior size on the 40 quite a bit.  they say its almost as roomy as the 60 now.  i'd imagine that means a redesign of the 60 to increase that size, then the 80.  we'll see.at the price the 40 is coming in at, and based on the ammenities, i'd have to say its definitely in the entry-lux class.  the base model starts at $24,190 and the t5 starts at $26,990 and gets into the mid-30s for the fwd model (awd info is not yet available)."
760,"February 12, 2004  2:21PM",mariner7,"i heard rumours new 3 will increase in size.  makes sense to move up so 1 can move in.  are the 1's just hatch, or will there be sedans and coupes?"
761,"February 12, 2004  4:27PM",chrisboth,so a madza 3 is as big as a bmw 3 and the 40 is now a entry lux sports sedan at 24k.  i think there should be some consistency in the classes so i am not so confused.
762,"February 12, 2004  4:37PM",blueguydotcom,"1 series is supposed to offer a sedan, coupe and convertible eventually.and nissan better make a g35 convertible.  a car that sexy must be topless."
763,"February 12, 2004  4:57PM",mariner7,"they do, it's called the z roadster.  not sure there's enough volume for two competing models.i read on nissan enthusiast forum that infiniti dealers want a product to compete with mb sl and  lexus sc, way up market!  they also want a smaller suv to compete with x3."
764,"February 12, 2004  5:21PM",chrisboth,a murano is about the same a the x-3 in price and size - i hope they dont rebadge that with infiniti labels.question if the mazda 3 platformed s-40 is a entry luz sedan what it the mazda 6?
765,"February 12, 2004  5:24PM",qbrozen,nothing from mazda is considered luxurylook at it like a nissan maxima vs. an infinity g35.  one is considered luxo and the other not.
766,"February 12, 2004  6:01PM",95gt,"they do have that already, is called the fx 35/45. based on same platform."
767,"February 12, 2004  6:11PM",chrisboth,wrong the fx 35/45 is based on the z platform (fm) and not the murano which is based on the underwhelming altima platform.
768,"February 12, 2004  7:03PM",riez,what gm platforms is the saab 9-3 related to?  couldn't remember if it is the new cavalier or the new malibu.  platform sharing has gotten out of hand!
769,"February 12, 2004  8:42PM",chrisboth,malibu...embarassing to the saabys to say the least.  the fm 350z platfrom should be sold to all manufacturers so thier cars are actually worth all that money.
770,"February 12, 2004 10:23PM",blueguydotcom,"they do, it's called the z roadster. not sure there's enough volume for two competing models.that's ludicrous.  the g35 ragtop would compete with the 330cic.  the 350 roadster doesn't really compete for the same buyers as the 330cic.  350z is performance and performance and wind.  the g35 would go after the hearts and wallets of people who want luxury and performance."
771,"February 12, 2004 11:04PM",chrisboth,a g coupe would look great topless - maybe alot like the z tho.  the sedan would look like canoe with out a top tho.  audi and bmw make it hard to compete in the convertible niche market for sedans.  how many 3 sales are convertible as a % of all 3 sales?  it's gotta be hard to make any money...
772,"February 13, 2004 12:02AM",buddhabman,"""saabys"" aren't phased.  we embrace the malibu, as many of us live there. ;-d.   here is another platform sharer. some quotes from www.carkeys.co.uk road testsubaru legacy 3.0rn no longer an outcastby ross finlay (10 nov 03)in previous years, subaru's suggestion that with the latest legacy it's targeting the ""leading prestige european marques"" would have seemed like pr spin from cloud cuckoo land. but since the 2004 model range offers smoothed-out exterior styling, greatly improved interior presentation, a more powerful top-of-the-range engine and even more precise handling, you'd better believe it.subaru may not be the class of the field when it comes to premium badge recognition, but the lighter-weight 2004 model, which goes on sale this month, sits even more four-square on the road thanks to its wider track, modified suspension and lowered powertrain.together with revisions to the steering and brakes, lower front and rear roll centres, and the advantage of four-wheel drive, all this means that the top-rated 3.0r feels to have similarly priced european saloons and estates beaten hands-down for handling.i can't think of any immediate competitors at prices in the mid-20,000 to 30,000 range which could match them for poise and traction on winding or hilly roads.the three-litre legacy is the best-balanced car in its class. driven briskly, it's stable and precise on corners, and there's no need to throw it about rather than hold it on line. out on the open road, anybody who feels the vdc cutting in - unless during an emergency attempt to miss the tractor - ought to blush at being so ham-handed.as i said before, if you have driven a legacy you know you don't have to worry about keeping up with audi's, bmw's, g35's or tl's in the twisties. the 3.0r might be getting the 6spd mt from the sti according to subdriven.com"

775,"February 13, 2004  5:39PM",chrisboth,the audi is probably cross shopped by 3cic buyers as they are really prob more lux conscience than performance conscience.  a super sprty sedan or coupe is compromised by the top being gone so there is an oxy moron factor there that suggests that these buyers aren't that into performance in the first place.  if you want to scoot around quickly in style with some rigitidy the a-4 will work pretty well i'd think.what are a-4 cabrio sales?
776,"February 13, 2004  6:46PM",blueguydotcom,"the a4 cab is a beautiful car, and it is more of a cruiser, i think if i wanted something more sporty from audi, i'd look for something called the tt you'd end up with a 2 seat car.  again that's not competition for the 330cic and for the dough it's not nearly as nice of a car.  a super sprty sedan or coupe is compromised by the top being gone so the compromise is slight if the engineering is solid.  we're talking a marginal weight penalty and if the engineers designed it as a convertible from the start, then the chassis flex is not that much of a difference.  10-20 years ago this wasn't true.  today many sports cars are made from the ground up as convertibles - z8, viper, etc.there is an oxy moron factor there that suggests that these buyers aren't that into performance in the first place. if you want to scoot around quickly in style with some rigitidy the a-4 will work pretty well i'd think.have you seen the times on that bloated cow?  it's a 4k lbs beast with an underwhelming engine.nobody is seriously challenging bmw's dominance of 4 place entry lux rwd convertibles.  we know buyers are grabbing up g35 coupes and sedans.  so a convertible is the next sensible step in infiniti's quest to steal bmw's thunder. weird, i'm the bmw owner here and you guys seem to think it's a bad idea for infiniti to offer a rwd convertible 4 place sports coupe."
777,"February 13, 2004  7:00PM",speedracer3,"btw...i would hardly call the upcoming s4 cabrio a joke, it's probably in m3 territory.http://www.edmunds.com/news/autoshows/articles/100537/page021.htm- l"

779,"February 13, 2004  8:26PM",speedracer3,that's the kind of pig i'll take anyday. according to edmunds both s4s (cabrio and sedan) can get 60 in the 5's range (c&d tested the sedan at 5 seconds flat)http://www.caranddriver.com/article.asp?section_id=33&article- _id=7574i hardly call that a pig!. the m3 hits 60 in about 5 secs and it has a weight advantage. who's oinking?

783,"February 13, 2004  9:26PM",blueguydotcom,that could be it.  i've grown up with convertibles and when i bought my daily commuter i seriously considered snatching up a 99 miata as i could get it cheap and mod it to my heart's content.  i ended up going safe with my choice but as soon as february rolls around i begin to pine for the sun.for the next few years i have to settle for dropping the windows and opening the moonroof.  or borrowing my families convertibles.
784,"February 13, 2004 11:45PM",speedracer3,"it's not porky, it just has awd. the awd system does add weight and causes driveline loss. regardless, the s4 compares well to the m3 (not going to slit hairs over fractions of seconds), even better you can get the s4 in a sedan which gives you all the convenience of 4 doors with the power of a sports car. i would get an s4 sedan over a m3 in a heartbeat. better yet, give an rs4 which would chew a m3 and spit it out."

""this time acura has done a bit too far for a fwd car"" quoted. do you know what they meant by saying that? i tried nissan maxima and 2000 integra gsr (and its nothing compared to tl), and it's totally a different experience but still better than the previous altima. there are 5 current report that gave the nod to the new tl, do you think they all dont know about understeer?. performance rating in a scale of 1 to 10, rwd may get a 10 while normal fwd usually get 6. if a fwd can get an 8 (g35=10,bmw=9, tl=8), for me that's more than enough while it gets more rating for luxury/comfort/styling/acceleration/snow/mpg/resale value/ maintenance cost, considering that people dont take on corner very often in their life or doing it in a race track. besides road styles, traffics in everyday's life dont support those kind of adventure.i buy a car according to my need just like everyone else. 96% normal driving with less than 5% taking on corners which is hardly to find in  these days without getting into trouble or heavy traffic on it.btw i like the new g35 coupe."

927,"February 27, 2004  7:07PM",blueguydotcom,"blueguydotcom... guess i'll just have to defer to your experience and expertise in all matters steering related? when it comes to what i prefer with my money i don't even understand how you'd have the temerity to toss up journalists as to proof a vehicle should feel a certain way to me.  i never said the rest of the world should bow down to the bmw or acura or any car.  i expressed my opinion on what was worth my money.  why would i or anyone else take into consideration what dozens of others might have indicated in their published reports when you have spoken? i honestly don't know why anyone believes a word written in car mags.  or reviews of anything.  i judge for myself and make my decision from there.  experience for yourself and build your opinions from that.  repeating quotes from car mags is nothing more than parroting the opinions of someone else.  you can tell me x car is horrible but i must experience it for myself.good example, i'm a huge movie buff.  i've had netflix for near 4 years.  i see movies constantly (watch zero tv) and because of my love for film i'll give just about everything a shot - b movies, iranian film, japanese, so-called bombs, etc.  with some friends one night we saw an ad for swept away on pay-per-view.  the common consensus among critics it was horrible.  someone snorted, ""who would see that?!""  i said i had on dvd and it was quite bad.  another friend added, ""leave it to you to confirm that the universally hated film was bad.""  it wasn't good enough that others liked it or disliked it, i had to experience it firsthand.there can be differences in two cars. often one test drive isn't enough. some specific single cars are lemons. others just aren't up to the rest. deviations from the mean. that's why i've driven two of them.  you can keep trying but in my experience with the is300, the car felt numb and disconnected.  the engine didn't offer the power i prefer.  like it or not, these are my opinions and i will not deviate from tham."
928,"February 28, 2004  3:00PM",riez,"blueguydotcom...  having owned a '98 540i6 and a '00 323ia, i have some appreciation for bmw steering systems.  i've also test driven 318ti, e39 525i, e46 325xi, z3, x5, e65 745i, etc.  (have you ever done the susan b. kosman drive for the cure?  it is a blast.)  i didn't mind fact e39 540i used recirculating ball instead of rack & pinion in the e39 525i/530i.  both work quite well.  but i also own two is300s, an automatic and a manual.  the steering in the is is every bit as good as that in the e39 or e46 bmws.  it is not numb.  nor disconnected.  and if it is, then i guess so, too, must be the bmws?this is opinion based on actual comparative ownership.  not just a short test drive or two.  (i also loved the steering in my former infiniti g20t and my former lincoln ls8 sport.) i find your following comment fascinating:""i honestly don't know why anyone believes a word written in car mags. or reviews of anything.""aren't you writing?  and essentially providing a review of something?  guess we shouldn't believe a word?  i'm a strong proponent of the value of good automotive journalism and subscribe to nearly two dozen automotive publications."

932,"March  2, 2004  3:17PM",cheerioboy26,the rumor is the updated g will be at the ny auto show next month along with the new m35/45....the g available in the fall.
933,"March  2, 2004  6:56PM",prattster,"it's good to hear the upgrades, however nissan/infiniti should learn from this and apply to all future new products that cutting corners to save a penny here will cut sales and hurt image possibly.  do it right from the onset and reap the rewards.  as in the new acura tl."
934,"March  2, 2004  8:05PM",chrisboth,"perhaps acura should learn from infiniti and make a sports sedan that is based on a sports car rather than front drive family car.  they all look to and learn from each other. perhaps they did us a service those infiniti guys and instead of spending more money on the g concept and making it pricier, they figured out that what matters is not the interior its perfect balance and a rigid rwd platform.  get that right first and then improve the fluff stuff."

937,"March  2, 2004  8:48PM",cheerioboy26,"that's right, after two years on the market, the g35 sedan is still selling at the same rate it was from the beginning.  it's also a more accurate comparison to compare sales in the same month of the preceeding year since there is an annual ebb and flow to car sales in general.  winter is not exactly the best time to sell a sports coupe or a convertible, for example.g35 sedan sales up 42% from feb 2003 sales of 2,410.  that comparison is more meaningful.i'm sure the tl did much better this month when compared to its sales in feb 2003, but you also have to consider it is an outgoing model vs. a brand new model comparision.after two years in the market, with all of the complaints about the lack of a manual in its first year, plus ongoing criticisms of the interior (some valid, some not), whether or not the styling will remain ""fresh"", the g continues to sell."
938,"March  2, 2004  8:49PM",cheerioboy26,"agreed.  they should do that from day one.  perhaps now that they have money, they will.  these cars that get this criticism most (g35, altima) were designed at the bottom of nissan's problems right when ghosn came aboard."
939,"March  2, 2004  8:55PM",danny1878,"4092 units is the best g35 sedan could do in 2003 (august/summer particularly), is the trend going up or down cheerioboy?"
940,"March  2, 2004  9:16PM",jrock65,"the tl's sales no doubt speak for itself in terms of the popularity of the car.but if i'm a tl owner, i wouldn't necessarily be happy with this, since this means that there are tl's all over the place.it seems the maxima increased in sales by a bit (5200).  for many nissan buyers, the maxima is a viable alternative to the g35 if one is willing to sacrifices some sport for room and fwd (for snow), and is not willing to pay extra for awd.  a fully loaded maxima and a g35 offer similar features for almost the same price.bmw sold 2492 325i and 467 330i.  this isn't surprising since the 3 is near the end of its model run.  sales will pick up when the next 3 is introduced, but bmw will have to do an excellent job.  the tl has been a big success, the g35 will only get better with the redone interior, and lexus seems serious about the next is. 3-series domination is no longer a gimme in this segment, as it once used to be.merc1,he didn't say when the 05 g35 would be released.  but since the 04 g35 and g35 coupe were released in august 2003, i would guess that the 05 would be released around the same time in 2004."
941,"March  2, 2004  9:19PM",chrisboth,the maxy should be compared to the tl imo.  looks like nissan wins that comp.  the g is comparable to nothing in the acura/honda lineup.  only for price sake do we get into the comparison game with g and tl.
942,"March  2, 2004  9:33PM",danny1878,"you're right jrock65, but if i want exclusiveness i wouldn't have bought a $30-40k car which can be afforded by most people. what makes them not buying them is a question of need and quality.the only thing that can stop people from buying  car are limited edition car, expensiveness or less quality.comparing maxima to tl, that is the only thing that you got? maxima is a failure in nissan lol no offense but is the truth. gtg."
943,"March  2, 2004  9:46PM",chrisboth,"if sales are the metric by which you judge success - the maxy rules all subjectivity about looks aside - whats wrong with it other than oversteer problems.  its fast, big and while not as nimble - its a fwd sporty sedan just like the acura...the fact that they compare the acura to the g actually says quite a bit for the tl i will concede.  i wouldn't go too far with it tho as the platforms are very different even if the tl drivers cant tell...""i stirred it up good this time ma"""
944,"March  2, 2004 10:20PM",cheerioboy26,"the trend is neither up nor down in my opinion in the long term.  picking out one month out of the air doesn't make or break a car.  but comparing jan/feb 04 to jan/feb 03 does have value.  you can't compare the summer number to the current number.  you won't find the manufacturers using that comparison either.  i'm not going to get into a sales argument, we all know the tl outsells the g35.  everyone has their reasons why they pick one over the other.valuable discussions regarding sales within a model line would probably be either year-to-year monthly comparisons, or cumulative comparisons - for example fall/winter 2003-03 to fall/winter 2003-04 or total yearly sales."

975,"March  4, 2004  7:53AM",victord1,"i believe i posted a message sometime waaaaaaay back, about six months ago, about my personal experience with both cars. my sister and i own both the '03 max se and '03 tl-s. the tl-s has slight advantages in handling, smoother ride, smoother engine at high rpm, and possibly exterior look. i like the max interior ergonomics, quieter engine, smoother trans/engine interactions (both cars have slush box), and bigger size.to most people, both cars are about equal overall, except for $2,000-$4,000 differences in prices, w/incentives on the max. now i haven't test-driven the '04 tl yet, but i assume that the new smaller size and slightly more powerful engine would increase its performance/handling potentials even further. i tested the '04 max the first day it arrived in the dealer and noticed that while the engine was even smoother/quieter than the '03 and the drive had been improved with the new rear ind. suspension set-up, the car's bigger size reduced the handling part to just marginally better than the '03. and don't even get me started with the new interior.......what the heck were they thinking?!?!when the new '06 bmw 3series come out in late '05, i'll probably trade in the max for the ""older"" version '05 3's. personally i think the current 3series has the best overall exterior look (especially in titanium silver) and the size is just about right for me--yes, i've grown tired of the bigger max. now if i can only get pass the bmw reliability issues......oh well, then there's always a tl :-)"

978,"March  4, 2004  2:56PM",speedracer3,"the one thing i do not like about about the tsx/tl is that they have not shaken their honda family resemblance. the tsx is an euro accord, and the tl ( i see the old civic tailights on this car) is just a larger version of it. what i liked about the g35 is that no current nissan car looks remotely like it. i applaud honda for giving acura a more aggressive ""look"", (the old tl was just blah to look at) but i look at a tsx/tl and  still see just another accord on the road."
979,"March  4, 2004  4:01PM",designman,"the maxima looks like a twin brother that is a little too addicted to sausage pizzas. i find the g35 look tolerable, but it's not exactly svelte either. sedans are bloated across all automotive brands... grotesque features... no attention to fine details. rubenesque is in.my advice to auto designers... have a salad."

984,"March  4, 2004  5:32PM",mariner7,"g35 & max share some family resemblance but total effect is quite different.  g35 sedan looks light, where max is just too heavy handed.when previous tl came out as a concept, i was very impressed by its look.  a relative of mine was looking for a car.  i recommended the car to him, he bought the car before it came out as production.  by the end of its cycle, i couldn't stand the sight of that car, to me the design aged really badly."
985,"March  4, 2004  6:51PM",victord1,"the new '04 maxima is never in my plan to replace my current max....honestly, i like mine better. to me it seems that while acura has moved the new tl closer to the bmw 3series, nissan did just the opposite with the new max. for someone who's looking for a family sedan with room and power to spare, the max is an excellent choice. however, for a single guy like me who likes corners and twisties, a more agile and smaller sedan would be more preferable.when it's time for my trade-up, the only cars i have in mind are the new tl , the g35/g35x, possibly the up-coming 250hp awd subaru (for the awd factor), and the 3series as the most favorite. i like almost everything about the car, except reliability.....sorry, didn't mean to sound like a broken record :-)"
986,"March  4, 2004  7:14PM",designman,"what i like about the g35 is the overall shape... numero uno in judging appearance imo. it has a fluid airfoil shape, similar to the 911. also, none of the details and proportions scream for attention. i think they could have done a better job with the headlights and grille though. headlights say maxima, grille says cadillac.tl has subtle details but is too wedgy and chunky in the rear. accordingly the shape is a bit unbalanced. and that swathe running just beneath the beltline looks like an afterthought... incongruous. i'd bet they added that near the deadline after thinking the car looked too vertical... to give the impression of less height. the wedge works better with smaller cars like tsx and rsx. by the way, on the acura website, they do a great job of reducing the chunky rear with lighting notice how dark the bumper is in all shots. but when it comes out into real available light, the butt is very large. i&#146;m sure the tl is going to be a winner, but i think it would have been dead-nuts perfect by reducing the angle of the wedge a bit. the wedge may say sport, but it does not say elegance larger sedans have to keep it to a minimum.not totally happy, but i&#146;ll take either one of these cars on looks for the most part there is harmony and order to the details and lines no unnecessary topography. they sure do beat the bangle bimmers."
987,"March  4, 2004  7:42PM",designman,"i can go for creases and edges but, again, they have to be subordinate to the overall shape. ctv has something going but the shape is so unbalanced that it looks freaky... like a caricature. and that vertical crease on the trunk and rear bumper is excess... makes the car look like a crushed orange juice carton.""...mushy ice cream that was refrozen.""good description. bangle calls it ""flamed surfaces""."

997,"March  5, 2004  6:30PM",raher,"'05 acura rl - as you probably know by now, a prototype of the production '05 rl is set to be unveiled at next month's new york international auto show. as usual, the temple of vtec will be in attendance, delivering full coverage. just recently we've heard some information from several diverse sources and the info seems to be fairly solid. some of the stuff has already been ""confirmed"" (by logical interpretation of public statements), but some of it is new. in the first category is the drivetrain - we can say with virtually 100% certainty that it will be a v6 with awd. the awd system will almost certainly be based upon the pilot/mdx's vtm system. one source (in our own forums) goes a step further and reports that the standard torque biasing will be 70/30 front to rear. current horsepower estimates peg the car at around 300hp. we've heard a number of figures on displacement ranging from 3.4 to 3.8l, but our best guess is that it will use a 3.5l variant of the tl's motor. ima does not seem to be a part of the equation at the time of launch. other interesting tidbits: the rl will feature fairly extensive use of aluminum body panels: roof, hood, and trunklid. the car will also continue to build upon acura's renewed emphasis on performance. the car is said to perform as well or better than the hot '04 tl (recall the tl 6mt's very impressive skidpad and slalom figures). based upon our sources, it seems the car will be positioned lower than where earlier rumors had it pegged (those rumors indicated it would be a true 7-series, s-class or lexus ls competitor). while the tl is positioned against the 5-series (yet priced like a 3-series), the rl will very likely fall somewhere in between the 5-series and 7-series in size. pricing will probably not deviate too far from the current rl's pricing, and the content level will build upon the tl's segment-blasting features. we've heard a few reports that luxury items such as power adjusted rear seats will appear on the rl. it's our understanding that the car's audio system was not developed with els. i will personally be surprised if it surpasses the tl's superb els system. as in past legend/rl models, the car's development was carried out almost entirely in japan and it will be built there as well."

999,"March  5, 2004  7:47PM",raher,"what sort of fool would want a performance sedan with 70% of the power going through the wrong wheels?maybe the same ""fools"" who are helping set sales records for fwd cars. maybe you need to ask yourself what qualifies you to call anyone a fool based on your opinion of what constitutes a performance sedan. this board is full of posts with statistics on performance and handling of fwd, rwd and awd and in the end there is very little actual difference in the objective facts. most of the differences are opinions held by individuals who seem to lack respect for someone elses opinion. i drive a fwd performance sedan and i am no fool."
1000,"March  5, 2004  7:57PM",blueguydotcom,"if you have awd, then the safety reasons people opt for fwd are now null.  with that safety element now gone, there's no reason for acura to retard the car's performance with the majority of the power running through the front wheels by default.  awd would allow acura to finally move away from that which keeps many buyers at bay.  you seem enamored with sales numbers so maybe this would appeal to you: if acura offers a performance sedan that finally drives like a performance sedan while also offering a drive system that meets the ""safety"" needs of the fwd buyers, acura could increase sales.  suddenly, two camps now see value where before only one group of buyers would.  i have nothing against fwd buyers.  i do have a problem with a manufacturer finally taking a step toward making a performance sedan by switching to awd but then curtailing the vehicle's performance by keeping power going through the steering wheels. awd properly set up on a tl would get my business and probably that of many others.  fwd on the tl will not.  they could have 500 hp coming out of that car and it could cut through the slalom at 90 mph.  i still wouldn't buy it as my primary fun car as it just doesn't cut it for me anymore."
1001,"March  5, 2004  8:41PM",raher,"i am not enamored by sales statistics. they do however point out whether a company is making money at what they are doing, assuming their cost elements are being met. they also show whether consumers are buying their product. from acura's perspective, they have always built fwd cars and they have always been able to sell them. the fact that tl sales are up 57% lets acura know they don't have to make any major changes to their manufacturing facilities by switching to rwd or awd. assuming their market share will increase by switching to another drivetrain is a risk they may not be willing to assume since they are already increasing sales. it will always be about making money for the major manufacturers.sales usually dictate changes. the rl has fallen way behind in the luxury class because it has not kept pace with the competition. the consumer has dictated that acura make changes or get out of that market segment. acura engineers have decided that a 70 - 30 split is what they want to do for their awd. i guess they forgot to consult you prior to their decision but they seem to have an enviable track record making decision on their own.it's all about choices and how those choices do or do not succeed in the marketplace. i don't think you can objectively prove that a given split is ideal for every awd car."

1058,"March  8, 2004  6:13PM",qbrozen,"ok.  thanks for the info.considering all that, seems like the performance package is a bargain when considered by itself and compared against other similar upgrades (the jcw mini comes to mind)."

1060,"March  8, 2004  6:21PM",speedracer3,"it's it's not a matter of being allowed. nismo makes performance packages tailored for specific cars like the 350z. not to say you can't take a part from a nissan kit and use it on an infiniti....what you won't be able to do is buy a nismo kit for say a g35 coupe. although this package is available in japan, you can't get it here. again, nissan feels that nismo takes away from the infiniti image. i think it's silly, and i hope nissan reconsiders."
1061,"March  8, 2004  7:10PM",riez,"the rather high cost of the zhp, a-spec, and l-tuned are just another factor in the value equation.  none of them are really worth it.  they just don't give you that much for the money.  much of the a-spec and l-tuned were for non-performance things like exterior changes.  guess that is why i bought an is300 manual.  could get a reliable fun car for about $30,000.  and it had hid and lsd. heck, i'd rather have a $30,000 325i sport 5-speed manual than a $40,000 330i zhp.  then i'd use the $10,000 to buy myself a muscle car (say amc amx or javelin)?"
1062,"March  8, 2004  8:02PM",danny1878,"i agree with riez on that, why we should buy a performance package for a sedan. if you are really into performance, go with the two seater. its better than buying performance package which doesnt perform (0-60 5.9), the a-spec which is mainly only stability & body makeup. sedan always have the luxury part, with too much performance, nobody cant even see it, its too fast.:-)"

1064,"March  8, 2004  8:31PM",95gt,my biggest concern with the packages is that that 5k you add up front will pretty much be worth nothing when you go to sell the car. sure some here or there will know what it means and want to pay more but most likely you will eat that cost. either way would love to have the package but the cost is pretty high
1065,"March  8, 2004  8:58PM",chrisboth,"do it yourself and dont pay someone to make mods to your car or do them one at time.  maybe some will want the body packages and the aspec buyers will be there for those who just want a newer looking or cooler looking car.  all the performance stuff anyone can do anywhere without much help.  the funnest thing of owning a g has been minor tweaks and little money that create small incrimental gains that i can notice and tweak.  do one and then do another down the road while appreciating each tweak on its own is my philosophy.   i would suggest most of us would rather buy the car without a perf pack and make the mods ourselves.  the zhp is an exception as it offers some big changes to a luxo car to get it to be alot differet.  for 200 bucks i added 10-14 hp with an intake.  for another 120 i added no real gains with my hyper grounding kit but added much smoothness and better responsiveness while eliminating the gurgle the intake created.  for another 450 i bought a crawford z car intake plenum which adds 20hp.  so for less than 1k i got about 20-25 hp at peak, increased the sound quality of the motor, get better gas mileage (4-5 mpg), have a smoother idle and start up and i don't have the hp drop at 6000.if they offered a $6000 nismo package i' say no, do the perf mods myself and save $5000 on body kit bolt ons that will never work out as well as if bolted on at the plant in the first place.now i belive i am running z power at the crank anyway - weight diff is about 150#.  anyone see the z in the lastest c&d.  they got a 13.8 1/4 running stock at 102 or so.  everytime they test the fm seems faster and faster!  break in alone is good for 20hp i'd bet with the vq."
1066,"March  8, 2004  9:42PM",shipo,"i am of two minds on this one.  in most cases, i would be inclined to buy the base car and then tweak it myself, most likely after the manufacturers' warranty expired.  that said, between the 325i and the 330i, and again between the 330i and the 330i zhp, one would be hard pressed to match the full package of the more expensive car for the same money, to say nothing of having a factory warranty on the extra goodies.  so, in the case of the 3-series, i'd be more inclined to go with the factory upgrade.best regards,shipo"
1067,"March  8, 2004 10:58PM",blueguydotcom,another funny thing about the 330i to zhp switch: it's really a crazy number of mods for only $2800 if one were to buy a 330i and get the sports package ($1200).

1069,"March  8, 2004 11:35PM",shipo,"okay, fair enough, i hadn't considered that the difference between the 330i sp and the 330i zhp was considerably less than just the cost of the zhp.  as such, i went through and configured the three as i would have ordered them.325i, 5-speed, metallic paint, leather, pp, sp, harmon kardon: $36,595330i, 6-speed, metallic paint, pp, sp, xenon: $41,570330i, 6-speed, metallic paint, zhp, leather, moon roof, xenon: 43,470so, in the ""as i would buy it"" configuration, the 330i comes at a $4,975 premium.  fairly substantial, however, imho, the considerable power gain, coupled with the 6-speed transmission, bigger brakes, and bigger wheels and tires easily justify the price.then there is the 330i to 330i zhp difference of only $1,900, a no-brainer on a car listing at over $40k.best regards,shipo"

1166,"March 11, 2004  2:37AM",shipo,"...regarding ""near luxury performance sedans"".as a point of reference, i drive a 2002 530i 5-speed with enough extra goodies to have brought the msrp up to nearly $49,000.  that said, i got a good deal and did the european delivery thing which resulted in a final price of just south of $43,000.  that of course does not count the cost of the european trip, but i would have taken it anyway (and rented a car while i was there).from my point of view, my car completely meets my needs, wants and desires.  it's fun to drive, economical (31 mpg on the highway), reliable (two years old and no unscheduled trips to the dealership), good looking inside and out, luxurious, certainly fast enough to get my attention, and capable enough to deal with it's power and ability to go fast.  what do i mean by that last bit?  on the autobahn during my ed trip, i was tooling along at the speed limiter (128.5 mph) when a motorcycle pulled out directly in front of me doing something like 60 mph.  i performed an emergency lane change (unfortunately when he saw me in the mirror he did the same, keeping him directly in my sights), and then performed what could best be described as an anchor dropping test of the brakes.  at our closest we only got within two feet of each other (him under full acceleration and me in panic stop mode) so he still had a little margin for his error and as such, he lived for another day (hopefully).having said all of that, i have been reading here that there are certain cars of a similar price and size with bigger (if not substantially bigger) motors that are ""superior"" vehicles for the money.  uh-huh, right.  i suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar cars with smaller engines, and i suppose to their way of thinking, it is.  to my way of thinking, that's the easy part, and that it's the rest of the package that makes the ""upgraded"" car truly superior.  would a cts-v for instance, have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation?  unknown, but i suspect that the cts-v is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias, and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver.balance, that's what the bmw offers, and yes, on paper it will certainly cost more for what you seem to get.  so, if i had it to do all over again, and if i was faced with the choice of a cts-v or my 530i for about the same price, what would i choose?  probably the bmw.  call me nave, call me dumb, call me wasteful, call me a poseur, call me whatever you like.  i can live with that.  ;-)best regards,shipo"

""they lied to us man, they lied to us!!!"" =]now the 2004 bmw 530 isn't a bad car, but it is overpriced.  and it looks like a honda from the rear.  and if you think it's any performance match for the cts-v, then i'm afraid you smoked too much of that green stuff back in the jungles of 'nam.first of all, i'd like to point out that the euros would make more high displacement engines if they could.  ""there's no replacement for displacement"".  in their home markets, they have moronic laws that tax based on engine displacement.  that's why they shift development dollars to those high revving buzzboxes.  when displacment is limited, and you're making a 6 or 8 cyllinder engine, you'll get more power out of dohc, even though ohv has a higher power density (which i will explain in a minute).second, displacement tells you nothing about an engines actual size.  repeat after me kiddies: displacement tells you nothing about an engines actual size.  gm's ls6, for example, is smaller than nissan's 3.5l vq (a v6 engine).  ohv engines have more compact packaging than dohc's.  that's why the ls6 has such high power density, unmatched by anything that bmw has got.third, the ls6 also produces power in a more fuel efficient manner than bmw's m5 and m3 engines.  it's smaller, more fuel efficient, and more powerful.  i fail to see what - if any - the redeeming aspects of bmw's m engines are.  and keep in mind, i'm talking about the m engines.  your 530 engine isn't even in this league.finally, i don't know where you got the impression that your 530 can outhandle a cts-v.  the cts-v smoked the bmw m5 and m3 on the nurburgring.  it's fast in 0-60, and it's no slouch in 60-0 thanks to the 14 inch brembos.  for that matter, i doubt your 530 could keep up with the plain old 3.6l 255hp cts that sells well equipped for ~$35,000."

1352,"March 20, 2004  1:42AM",raher,"ooh boy those rwd only folks have got a task on their hands coming up with an explanation as to  how this could have happened. i guess the guy driving the tsx didn't know he didn't stand a chance because of torque steer and knowing in advance those rwd guys had ""perfect balance"".blah blah blahonce again that old addage turns out to be true..when the green flag drops, the bs stops!"
1353,"March 20, 2004  2:12AM",kdshapiro,"between the tl and 3series. it depends on your priorities. if i wanted seat of the pants m3, for 3 series prices, it would be zhp at the top of the list. if i cared not about the precision feel of a bmw and slickness of the looks and just needed a car.. i will admit if those were the only 14 cars in the universe, it would be the acura tl."

1355,"March 20, 2004  4:35AM",pg48477,"s60r would probably outperform any car on the list, but it's a bit expensive. i would consider 330 but new model should come out soon. if only tl would come in awd. i think tl with a-spec would handle as well as 330 performance package, but 5k+installation is to much."
1356,"March 20, 2004 11:16AM",cybersol,"i find it quite amusing that for 5 pages or so the discussion focused on what the discussion was about. reminds me so much of meetings meant to talk about other meetings.i think pat's list is a good one. one addition in both my opinion and from magazines that compare vehicle in this class would be the lincoln ls. first of all, lincoln is obviously meant to be ford's luxury brand. secondly, the ls costs between 30-42k in most configurations. third the car itself definitely has both luxury and performance intentions. by all owner accounts, it performs and handles well, even if i personally would not be interested in a ford product at this time, so that i have not driven one.back to talking about cars... if i were shopping today, taking into account that my priorities are size, performance, price, reliability, and then luxury... these sedans would be on my shopping list in this order:1) infiniti g352) acura tl3) bmw 330i4) everything elseenjoy, cybersol"
1357,"March 20, 2004  7:09PM",qbrozen,"i said it before, and i'll say it again, i really think this needs to be added.according to c&d, 0-60 in 6.5 and:in most track trials, the lincoln set stellar marks. although it was wearing all-weather tires, usually thought to be a disadvantage, it outran all but the benz on the skidpad and topped all in the lane-change test. very shrewd choices were made in the chassis tuning of this car.and since the sport v8 comes in at $40,500 with delivery, the only fault i see with it is the lack of a manual tranny.  but i don't see that as a reason to exclude it because some folks prefer an auto and some even require it."

1363,"March 21, 2004  5:05AM",scott1,"i went through all of the comparisons of the cars on this list in january while i was trying to decide which car to order. i ended up ordering a cts with the luxury/sport package and the dvd navigation system. (blue chip exterior, light gray/ebony interior).i drove the bmw 3 series and liked its driving characteristics, but didn't care for its styling or interior room. the same can be said for the mercedes c class..i drove a v6 version and while it was a solid quiet riding car, it didn't have the interior space i was looking for.i very seriously considered the lexus es 330, but ultimately decided that while it rode very smooth and quietly, the handling just wasn't there. the fact that it basically looked like a camry didn't help either.i had a bad prior ownership experience with a honda, so did not consider the acura.the cts seemed to have exactly what i was looking for. a quiet comfortable ride combined with excellent handling, plenty of interior  space in both the back and front seats, and a very refined smooth and powerful engine. the real bonus for me is the styling of the exterior though...the cts is one fine looking car from any angle, and doesn't look like just another box on wheels.i checked with my dealer today and he expects my car to be delivered within the next week or so. i'm looking forward to that."

1365,"March 22, 2004  3:09AM",kahunah,"last week on the highway, this guy in a wrx sti drove up behind me and was riding my bumper...for a short time. fed up with his arrogant behavior, i dropped my '04 tl's stick from 5th to 3rd, hit the gas, and left him in the dust, and i didn't even have to floor it. he finally caught up to me, so i did it to him again (6th to 4th). he never did pass me and i'm sure i ruined his day. i won't say how fast i was going but the tl surprised even me."
1366,"March 22, 2004  3:20AM",blueguydotcom,"two options here:1. the driver wasn't playing like you were.2. the guy didn't know how to use turbos.  your v6 with 238lb-ft of torque on a 3400 lb car really isn't a match for a person who knows how to use the sweet spot of their turbos on a car that sports 300 lbs-ft at 4000 rpm and the car weighs 200 lbs less.  in fact, it's a one sided affair."
1367,"March 22, 2004  3:59AM",fedlawman,"i finally had a chance to watch the race this afternoon (i taped it earlier this morning).it was a very exciting race, and also great to see a brand new car with little development time (tsx) do so well against the established benchmark (325i).  it was also interesting to note how evenly matched all of the cars in this competition are, even though there is a combination of fwd and rwd, and ""luxury"" (bmw 325i) vs. ""economy"" (nissan sentra).which begs the question - if rwd vs. fwd doesn't matter at sebring, why do so many ""enthusiasts"" think it makes a difference on i-90?"

""how does one measure the hp at the crank?  is there a special dyno for this is or did the tl owner do some funky math to get from the wheels to the crank?  my guess is the math involved to make the 282 leap is rather fuzzy at best.  the tl is one great value if you can stomach the wheel jerking from your hand once in a while but it is not sti beater. if the sti was between 4500 and 7000 the whole time you would have seen nothing but fumes.  the power band of the tl is quite evident in the 50-120 stats and 0-100.. i suggest you take a look at the sti stats for those metrics before you get too enthusiastic about the less than torque ridden 3.2.""which begs the question - if rwd vs. fwd doesn't matter at sebring, why do so many ""enthusiasts"" think it makes a difference on i-90? "" this explains much - i suggest anyone questioning rwd in context of freeway driving actually drive a decent rwd car on some back roads.  if someone thinks they are going to enjoy - let alone accept the seemingly foreign concept of throttle induced overteer on the highway, i imagine they will be out of the genepool soon enough.  the oversteer i paid 35k for is never enjoyed on a highway - it's enjoyed on the hairpins of an open field with a two lane country road with 10 foot tall cows and fog smoked expanses and no one in sight....and carefully pressing the throttle just enough, with just enough feedback to push the weight back to the rear wheels just as that very power causes them, with buttery smooth finesse, to slide into the perfect exit angle and keep traction where wide open throttle can push your back into the leather.  unless you've actually experienced this you will keep wondering!"

1386,"March 22, 2004  8:11PM",chrisboth,yes my soon to be mother in law has one.  i'd rather have a v-6 passat 5sp.  it's quiet and fairly nice interior but very low on the mercedes quality scale and not to big not to mention the fact it just looks like a baby s class.  it's ok but - so is the 28k passat for that matter.  the engine isn't bad but it doenn't beg to be pushed like a g that for shore.
1387,"March 22, 2004  9:39PM",dhanley,"i drove one at the gm autoshow-on-the-road.  they had a loopy test track, and a lot of cars to take out on it.  the c320 really handled better than i expected and was very refined.  it had a bit more non-melodious engine noise than i expected; i was surprised by that.  it was nice, but it was also a 45k car.  the cts was there too.  it was nice, but a bit too isolated for me.  i like quiet, but i want to feel the road and hear the engine rev.  somehow, the interior just seemed to whisper chevrolet.  it seemed spacious inside, which probably appeals to other more than it does to me.  but if you like the interior and isolation, this is probably a really good car.  drove the 9-5 aero, that was probably my favorite, i really like the looks, interior, the actual out the door price ( they have $6000 in rebates on it now and sell at invoice(??) ) and i love the engine.  but it didn't handle as well as the cts or the c320.  the 9-3 was there but it was the base 9-3 linear and didn't impress, mostly due to the interior.  the engine needed more power, but the handling was really quite good. it tracked well and had good feedback.  i recently sat in a 9-3 convertable at the autoshow later and thought that the interior in it was really nice, so maybe it's improved.  also saw the s40 at the autoshow, and the interior really looked cheap to me, and there were several broken parts inside, which i guess could have been due to it's being a prototype and suffering autoshow abuse.  but based on the numbers this is a really good car, so i would look at it again.  i drove an x-type 3.0.  the car looks really good, i thought, and the interior is very attractive, but again there were 3 demos at the dealer and 2 had broken parts inside ( one had the cell phone  cover broken by the dealership owner ).  all the driving controls felt too light to me, and the engine despite its increased hp felt weak at low rpm's--i didn't feel that i could pass on the highway without dropping out of fifth, but i thought it sounded great when i revved it up.  i didn't feel that i got a lot of steering feedback but it was also impressively quiet on the highway.  the door sill was really high and the back doors only opened 45 degrees so it was hard for me to get in the back.  i drove a new 325i and it's good, but i couldn't help but feel that it's been somewhat lexiified.  the shifter had vaguer detents and the engine noise and steering effort were dialed down.  i might have liked it a lot more if it had the sport package.  i don't like the newer bmw designs, and i look askance at the increasing complexity of these cars.i drove a g35, too,  it certainly had a lot of power, and had pretty good feedback.  i was mostly turned off by the interior which i felt was pretty cheap and the amount of tire noise that got into the interior ( too much for my tastes ).  also, my friend who has one reports really poor mpg.  oh, test drove the is300 as well.  i thought it looked  ( warning: personal taste issue ) tacky inside, and was too consistently noisy due to road noise.  also, the interior didn't fit my frame very well.  i thought several cars felt better handling around town.  drove a last-gen a4 1.8t.  overall thought it felt very composed and had a nice interior, but it definitely needed more engine.  also, a friend with a passat has had a dismal reliability experience.  but if i was leasing it from a subservient dealer i would probably feel ok about it.  the sporty acuras i've been in (cl-s, integra,rsx) i've had a hard time getting comfortable in, so i haven't even bothered to test drive them.  i haven't looked at the new tl-s.  there was nothing that made me feel that i need to go out and trade my 328i, but i want to test a 9-3 arc if i happen to be near a dealer with some free time.  i almost hope i hate it so i don't feel the urge to waste money on a car swap.  dave"
1388,"March 22, 2004 10:24PM",buddhabman,"sounds like the c320 drives pretty nice, albeit $$$$$ that's great that you have had the chance for so many drives. i have an aero wagon, and as much as i like the car, it does need some stiffer springs and stiffer rear sway bar to help the handles. it tracks well but rough stuff in the canyons makes it hit the bump stops and there is more roll. great brakes, and isn't it fast, 0-60 is alright but i tell you people 60-120 in an aero is something else. i wish they would bump up the power in the 9-5 aero.  all the saab tuners have emp's to take it to 280-300hp.   i think the 9-3 aero is a sweet looking car. if they bumped it to 250/250 it would be killer."
1389,"March 23, 2004 12:10AM",dhanley,"agree.  the c320 was nice but seemed expensive to me for what it was--solid, quiet, ok handling but not really extraordinary, while having no glaring flaws.  i guess i didn't realize the price of the cts i drove.  i want to the caddy website and i see that was probably a $43k car ( 3.6l, xenons, upgraded sterio, sunroof ).  but i suppose there will be many thousands off at some point.  the 9-5 was as you describe--swayed more than i liked, and understeer was very easy to provoke; i didn't feel secure pushing it in turns.  it's acceleration was so-so 0-30 then after that, really impressive.  to be blunt, i thought it was a very well-thought out car suffering from an old chassis; it could have used more suspension travel and structural ridgidity.   i expect the 9-3 areo will be 250hp beofre long, the upcoming 9-3 hatch is supposed to get 250hp out of the same motor with direct injection.  you can already get a chip for that hp level, but i shy away from mods and prefer to get the power stock."

1401,"March 24, 2004  1:26PM",chrisboth,also some race track certainly favor fwd cars and some fwd cars have no understeer since they are so finely and hard tuned and they can even get oversteer in some setups cant they? what most suggest is that the balance from a rwd setup is superior for street cars and that the fun one has while playing with oversteer in the twisties is way more fun than getting torque feedback in your steering.  i would prob take an rsx over the 3 in that race..great car.

1469,"March 27, 2004  5:56PM",raher,"sales figures reflect how any automobile is being received by the consumer. in the long run they determine whether any model continues in production based on the manufacturer's defined return on investment. sales determine whether a manufacturer makes changes to an existing model to improve sales or whether they decide to introduce a new model.sales figures certainly do not denote superiority in terms of styling, performance, handling, etc but they do denote what combination of these the consumer prefers. the wholesale increase in hp across most of the models in this discussion is an example. i am amused by the comments i see here insinuating that ""joe blow"" buys mediocre cars and some individuals are above that because they buy cars that they have somehow defined as ""different"".  superiority in the marketplace is what every manufacturer is seeking. that marketplace is however defined differently by different manufacturers. ferrari does not have the same sales goals as honda, nissan, toyota but they do have some numbers they want to meet in order to maintain their place in whatever market they decide is important to them. you can't discount sales as a very important indicator. the reference to mcdonalds is an attempt to deride one of the most globally successful businesses. it doesn't matter if joe blow eats there and you don't. other businesses would kill for mcdonald's success in their market. freedom of choice is a wonderful thing. the marketplace inevitably determines what survives and sales figures are the feedback from the marketplace to the manufacturers. it will also inevitably determine what you get on your new car in the future. navigation systems weren't on any cars a few years ago.the sales figures for the new tl reflect an acceptance on the part of the consumer that acura is on the right track with their blend of styling, handling, performance etc.the new acuras will drive changes to bmw , nissan , toyota and others just as they drove the changes to the new tl.. competition is also a wonderful thing. the consumer wins in the end.most of the discussion on this board is ""my car is better than your car"" supported by whatever article, personal experience or personal opinion the author chooses to use to attempt to justify their position. no one is right and no one is wrong since none of it can really be objectively substantiated.it is always interesting to hear from the participants here however and many of the opinions are put forth from an obvious informed background. i learn a lot here and also laugh a lot.god bless the internet."

1493,"March 28, 2004 10:03PM",fedlawman,"agreed.the tsx is definitely at a disadvantage in top gear acceleration tests due to its gearing (you can really see this effect in the 270 hp tl's top gear figures!).the reason why the tsx was excluded from the recent c&d comparo is because it was a ""$35,000 sedan comparo"" and the tsx is only $26,500. i honestly think (must admit some bias here) the tsx would have scored higher than the tl because of it's overall better balance and lack of handling vices.i hadn't seen the automobile numbers, but i think they look a little conservative. there's always going to be some variation from test to test but, i've owned several 8 second 0-60 cars over the years, and the tsx isn't one of them."

1497,"March 29, 2004 12:22AM",riez,"fedlawman...  actually, the tsx did ""win"" that 7/03 mt comparison test and, even at 7.9 secs, it actually had the ""quickest"" 0-60 mph time of these three cars.don't get mad, but as i've said before, the tsx's small naturally aspirated 2.4l i4 just doesn't generate a ton of hp (and what it does do it needs high rpms to do) and generates way less torque (esp. useable torque down low).has anyone ever seen a published test result for a tsx automatic?  wonder if it pushes 9 secs. 0-60 mph?"
1498,"March 29, 2004  1:11AM",fedlawman,"actually, car and driver and i see eye to eye on the tsx...we both love it. (i guess it's no secret which magazine acura picked to spend advertising money on, huh?).seriously though, the general consensus is that the tsx 6-speed is a low-to-mid seven second car and the automatic adds about 1/2 second to that. seems about right to me.as for the small & lacking power comments, i guess it depends on what you're comparing it too. of course the 2.4l i-4 has a displacement and power deficit compared to nissan's 3.5 l vq motor. what car in this segment doesn't (besides the tl)? but compared to all the rest (audi 3.0l, bmw 2.5l, lexus 3.0l, saab 2.0l, m-b 1.8l, jaguar 3.0l), it appears that the tsx's 200 hp stacks up just fine.the recent c&d $35,000 sedan comparo that you mentioned had the 325i as the 3rd fastest car behind the g35 and tl (no surprise there). consider how close the tsx and 325i are...remember this torque chart?rpm 325i tsx2000 150 1492500 160 1563000 168 1603500 176 1624000 173 1644500 169 1665000 172 1635500 167 1626000 161 1596500 142 1557000 --- 150the tsx's ""little 4 cylinder motor"" is very close to the bmw's i-6, which explains why the tsx runs just a 1/10th or two behind the 325i in most acceleration tests (which is also where the is300 ran in that c&d comparo). also notice that the honda i-4 offers 90% of peak torque (166) from 2000 rpm all the way to 7000 rpm...that's a 5000 rpm-wide powerband to play with! how many cars can make that claim?so let me agree with you up to a point. the tsx engine is small and underpowered compared to the g35 and tl. compared to every other car in this segment, it's a force to be reckoned with."
1499,"March 29, 2004  6:07AM",blueguydotcom,"you keep that tsx engine perculating and it's torque is enough to make it pull confidently.  i prefered the free-revving, liquid smooth 2.4 in the tsx to the tighter, punchless 2.5 in the 325i.  oh, the price certainly helped make the tsx more palatable too.   26k (yes it was offered to me at 26k before i even attempted to haggle) v. a stripped 325i that was still hovering over 30k with discounts."

1511,"March 29, 2004 11:59PM",riez,keep in mind the tsx uses a dragstrip-like 4.73:1 final drive.  that gives it the initial launch.  it also then has overdrive 5th and 6th gears to offset this final drive.  the 6th overdrive is very deep at 0.66:1.  the is300 uses 3.73:1 final and 0.85: 5th.bmw has been using direct drive 5th (1.00:1) in past e46 323i/325i with various final drives under 3.50:1.  the new 6-speeds bring overdrive.

1539,"April  2, 2004  3:38AM",pg48477,"acura is talking about introducing a revolutionary awd system, which not only distributes torque front to rear but also left to right. i think it might be available on 05tl.>>>honda develops world&#146;s first super handling all-wheel-drive available this fall in the acura rl (north america) and the legend (japan) tokyo - april 1, 2004 --- honda motor co., ltd. today announced the development of a new super handling all-wheel-drive system, called sh-awd, that provides cornering performance that responds faithfully to driver input, and outstanding vehicle stability. a world&#146;s first, the sh-awd system combines front-rear torque distribution control with independently regulated torque distribution to the left and right rear wheels to freely distribute the optimum amount of torque to all four wheels in accordance with driving conditions. the new system will be available this fall in the acura rl (north america) and the legend (japan). by monitoring driver input and driving conditions, the sh-awd system determines the optimum front-rear and lateral (left-right) torque distribution. this information is then conveyed to the rear differential, where direct electromagnetic clutches continuously regulate and vary front-rear torque distribution between ratios of 30:70 and 70:30, and lateral torque distribution in the rear wheels between ratios of 100:0 and 0:100. torque is used not only for propulsion, but for cornering as well, resulting in a significant enhancement in vehicle maneuverability. the sh-awd system is composed of sensors to detect steering angle, lateral g, and other vehicle information; an ecu; and the rear differential. the direct electromagnetic clutches inside the rear differential, another world&#146;s first, employ electromagnets to obtain precise control over the multi-plate clutches. built-in search coils monitor the gaps between the electromagnets and the magnetic body to achieve precise, continuously variable torque regulation. the rear differential is also equipped with a built-in acceleration device, yet another world&#146;s first. during cornering, the track of the outside rear wheel normally falls outside the average of the tracks of the front wheels. the outside rear wheel does not rotate fast enough to keep up with the front wheels, preventing efficient transmission of torque. to counteract this problem, the sh-awd acceleration device alters the gearing to speed up the outside rear wheel&#146;s rotation relative to the front wheels. this reduces torque transmission losses and significantly improves vehicle maneuverability. at honda, driving pleasure is regarded as one of the most important factors in vehicle development. the new sh-awd system features &#147;feed-forward&#148; control, which utilizes the degree of driver input to determine appropriate torque distribution. this results in a super-neutral steering feel that responds with optimal faithfulness to the driver&#146;s handling of the steering wheel, realizing outstanding driving comfort and stability. from official honda japan site...http://www.honda.co.jp/hdtv/news/2004-4040401a/"

1735,"April  7, 2004  5:10PM",jmess,some things that riez didn't mention:1. you can't select or hold 1st gear with the e-shift automatic gear box. if you launch from a stop with something less than 2/3rd throttle it will short shift to 2nd to save fuel.2. the front dash side vents have chrome stripes on the louver directional levers that reflect in the door glass about eye level with the side mirrors. the solution is to black them out with a marker pen.3. you can't deactivate the skid control. i found vsc to be a little intrusive during a trip to the local race track on a wet day 4. the traction control is way to sensitive. fortunately you can turn it off so you can take full advantage of the limited slip.5. shock valving. on the e-shift car is a little too soft when you approach the handling limits of the car.6. the paint chips far too easily. a clear bra is your friend in this case.7. i have the sportcross version and it doesn't have an internal rear hatch release button or lever. the hatch is manually open from the outside when all the doors are unlocked.

1753,"April  7, 2004 11:41PM",pg48477,"don't forget it's only a concept. tl concept also had 300hp not 270, so hp can go up or down before this car hits show room. in any case i think 300hp is good enof to compete with 6 cylinders versions of i's competition. one of the reasons m45 did so poorly is luck of v6. most of gs, e and 5 are being sold with 6 cylinders, in fact 80% of gs is i6. i don't think acura wants to spend money on something they can't sell, if the come up with full size sedan maybe they will build v8. this way they'll be able to use the engine for two vehicles and maybe full size suv.in any case exterior does not look exiting at all, to bland. interior is very nice."

(not an exact quote, i don't have the mag here in front of me)to sum it up:the g35 dominated since there was no bmw competition.  but the cts keeps creeping up in these comparisons, coming in second this time.  it pulled a 6.6 with an auto, which will probably mean a 6.2 when the m6 hits lots this june as an '05.  so i could drive a 5 series in size and comfort that goes 6.2 for as little as $32k or i could force my friends to cram into the back of a 3 series and either spend a little more money for equal performance (regular 330) or spend way more for slightly better performance (330 perf package).  no thanks, i'm not into paying more for less just to have what everyone else thinks is ""cool"".  i work hard for my money and the status symbol factor of bmw does nothing for me.for me, a person who needs to use the back seat at times, but still wants a balanced sports sedan the g35/cts are clearly the value leaders.brian"

1848,"April 10, 2004  4:32PM",shipo,"hmmm, my definition if ""tramlining"" is when you are driving on roads, primarily in california, that have parallel grooves cut in them for water relief so as to help prevent hydroplaning.my definition of ""torque steer"" is when the driven front wheels take steering matters into their own hands when power is applied, especially during a turn or when the road surface is sloped.when i described the phenomena on i-80, which is (relatively) smooth asphalt and has two ruts, one for the left tire and one for the right, i was referring to torque steer, at least according to my definition.best regards,shipo"
1849,"April 10, 2004  4:40PM",speedracer3,"definition: the annoying tendency of some front-wheel drive vehicles to pull to one side when engine torque is applied. in other words, you step on the gas and the car wants to steer right or left. by redesigning the power train to use equal length half shafts between the transaxle and wheels, the tendency towards torque steer can be greatly reduced. the other cure is to keep off the gas"

1887,"April 14, 2004 12:14AM",glenford,"finally got to drive a g35x today (nearest dealer is 50+ miles away) on my way to the ny auto show.  looking for some feedback from others who have driven both this and either a 325xi or 330xi - i drove both of those a month ago (that dealer only 45 miles away - in a different direction).my needs list - awd, highly reliable, ""compact"" size, fun to drive, and it falls off after that.  price is a consideration.my observations:awd performance - i'll never know from a test drive not in nasty snow - assume they are both good.price - g35x, by a couple thousand or more, depending on if i compare to 325 or 330.reliability - varies by the individual car, of course, but infiniti looks to have (significantly?) better oddssize - comparable, but the bmw seemed a little cramped to me (the oft-repeated comments about the ""grade"" of the interior between the two is of lesser concern to me - both are fine)fun - this is a little harder, since the lag between my drive times was long, but here's how it felt, and i'm looking for your observations:there is a noticeable power difference between the 325 and the other 2.  maybe daily it doesn't matter, but it's easy to feel.  otherwise, the power seemed to me to come on much more smoothly in the 330 than the g35.  g35 might ride better, but i also felt that it was a little over-sensitive to minor inputs, and i didn't feel that in the bmw.  they all braked strongly (as much as i can test in a test drive).i'm not looking to restart the ""i love my xxx, it's the best"" wars, but i would be interested in hearing from those who have driven both (or all 3).  all are seemingly very nice - even near-luxury (!) cars.interesting cars from the show (in their awd versions, which sometimes means coming soon) - lexus 2005 gs, saab 9-2 (even if it is a subaru ;-), acura rl (but too big for me). acura said all their cars would be awd if i wanted to wait. infinity m (again too big, though).  it was crowded down there today, bad weather or not."

1889,"April 14, 2004  2:57AM",jrock65,"i agree w/ rderizans that the leather in the g is nicer.  but i prefer softer leathers.the biggest weakness of the g is grade of interior materials (other than seats), but if you're not bothered by them, the g35x should be a top candidate.  seeing that the power difference (or lack thereof) in the 325ix was noticeable to you, i'd recommend not getting it.  might nag you constantly.  the 330ix is a fine machine, you can't go wrong with it either."

( i don't blame them for this one.)3. this moring, my car stopped on highway ( see my previous post). the malfunction fuel gauge showed that i have half tank of gas, actually the tank is empty. when i call the dealer, they said they can treat it as urgent service, but, again, i have to rent a car at my own expense, because they don't have loaner.you can get a loaner, if you schedule the service several weeks earlier. if it is anything urgent comes up, sorry, you have to rent a car yourself. the problems are:1. they want to cut loaner cost by having less loaners,2. the mb cars have too many problems, people are busy bringing in their cars to get fixed.i hope i haven't bought this car!  i am thinking about selling this car before the warranty expires. i just can't afford the time, the money and the patience. i just can't!finally, a funny thing, when i was at the dealerseveral days ago, i overheard a lady who drives a coupe complained a problem, i told her i have had that problems about 10 times. she said, that's no big deal, she still have had a problem, b problem, c problems,...."

1945,"April 22, 2004  5:36AM",kahunah,"""until hyundai acquires that bulletproof rep, i can't see people associating hyundai with that luxury brand image.""back in 1986, honda did not exactly have a bulletproof reputation nor could most people associate honda with a luxury brand image. yet, they did the unthinkable and launched a luxury car brand...acura. five years later in 1991, the legend coupe won motor trend's prestigious import car of the year trophy. the same year, the integra took the laurels as one of car & driver's ten best. the integra would continue to make the ten best list in four of the next ten years. the legend coupe won the title twice.kinda makes you think, don't it?"
1946,"April 22, 2004  9:31AM",saugatak,"not disagreeing with any of your points.  if hyundai makes a great car at a great price, yes perhaps they could compete.but there are several factors working against that.first, the competition now is much more intense than ever before.  cadillac is producing nice cars, chrysler is coming out with interesting product, the [non-permissible content removed]. big 3 are in the game now, and though mb and bmw have stumbled, they're still major players.what worked back then won't necessarily work now.second, i don't know hyundai's cash situation, but i don't think it's as good as honda or toyota when they launched their luxury brands.in any case, i don't think hyundai belongs in this thread since they are not yet considered luxury.hopefully hyundai will follow the path of the japanese.  more quality cars, choices and competition can only benefit consumers.what will be interesting is what happens when the chinese come up with their own car brands and start entering the world market."

2039,"May  7, 2004 11:48PM",darnac,"not to take this too off topic but since we are discussing the audio sytstems in comparable vehicles stereo (2 channel) is and probably will always be the audiophile's choice. music reproduction is not about being in the center of it. having played orchestral brass for many years you do not want to sit in the center of music. i dont think you would care either for the way a rock band sounds from between the singer and the drum kit. music reproduction is about creating a sound stage that accurately reflects the original true source. when you go to the concert whether it is classical or rock the sound starts in front of you. there are no speakers at the rear. room dynamics will bounce sound all over the place and these diffractions generally speaking should be avoided. 5.1 is what hollywood uses and for that purpose (movies) it probably is best. top gun with the planes flying front to back is best created by 5.1, 5.2 or what are they now talking about 6.2 with a speaker overhead or something. it is a fact that dvd-a sounds much better than cd so from that standpoint the acura has a big advantage. we may see some manufacture going for the better still sacd but i have not heard anything yet. if any of you are ever in las vegas in january they have the annual audiophile manufactures convention. they have dozens of rooms with some systems costing upwards of $100,000.95% of the rooms are 2-channel stereo and most of those rooms use analogue (records) not digital sources."

2051,"May 11, 2004  1:29AM",darnac,i think the volvo may be closer than the subaru. i am very interested in the new legacy but it is more sport than luxury and may not even be near luxury. no steering wheel audio controls. i know the is300 does not either. early rumours were the legacy would not have a remote trunk release. the ride on the gt is going to be firmer than luxury. the gt has a bunch of quality thrown at it but they did not try to hard to convey an image of luxury. they are most certainly going for the sport crowd with 250 lb/ft of torque and lightened body panels. the gt may be my next car but i am getting it for the driving dynamics and not the cush. i currently drive an 02 mb c240 which is slow but very quiet and has near luxury features.
2052,"May 11, 2004  2:03AM",cwbarrett,i have a 2002 altima and ready to trade up. after reading these boards i took a 330ix stick for a test drive today and i don't understand all the praise. a stiff ride (all 330 have sport suspension acording to the sales guy) like that may be good for the track but it beats you up on new england roads. yes the handling was tight but i didn't feel a strong connection with the road. the shifting was not overly smooth and it had the pickup of a 2001 maxima. i felt the interior was very plain.  i was really disappointed.
2053,"May 11, 2004  2:42AM",shipo,"first, a correction; not all 330 sedans have the sport suspension.  the 330i has the sport suspension; the 330xi has the standard suspension.relative to the ""stiff ride"", i guess it's all a matter of personal taste.  the suspension on the 330xi that you drove is the exact same suspension that i had on my 1999 328i, and if anything, it was too soft.  as such, i ordered the sport package on my next bmw, and once again, if anything, it's too soft.  oh, and by the way, i live in new england.regarding not feeling connected to the road, well, with the standard 205/50 r17 all-season tires that the ""xi"" comes with, i'm not too surprised.  if you want to feel connected to the road, drive a 330i with the sport package (sp) or better yet, drive the 330i with the performance package (zhp).  fwiw, the sp will only make a marginal compromise in the ride of the car while improving the handling considerably.  the zhp will magnify that compromise/improvement considerably more.regarding the interior, yes, bmws do typically have simple and very functional interiors, some of us like them, some folks don't.  the good news is that there is plenty of competition in that segment these days and you won't have to look too much further a field to find something that suits you better.best regards,shipo"

2061,"May 11, 2004  5:31PM",designman,"in nearly every thread around here there is a wide tolerance for digression. it makes for stimulating uninhibited conversation. it's one thing when forum hosts get involved because this is a privately owned place and it is their prerogative, but getting tossed by another poster for questionable reasons is out of line. as far as i am concerned, if a car doesn't fall within the topic but compares to these cars it should be discussed by default. it's only normal and natural. furthermore, there's the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. and since this place is not a court of law, i think it would be better to adhere to the latter."

2110,"May 24, 2004  1:16PM",chrisboth,crawfordz.com has the plenum for 395.  kinetix makes a plastic one that has had some issues for about the same price.  crawford takes a nissan plenum takes the top off and welds on sheet metal to make a new shape.  on the g forum i frequent with 3500 members there is an absolute consensus that this is the besst bang for buck mod out there for the vq.  this is not a bolt on honda civic toy this is a fundamental change for the better breathing ability this car should have in the first place if not for the shape of the z hood for which this iteration of the vq is designed.  have you bud call and chat with doug at crawford and he'll be on board tuning like the rest of us who find that those z nuts do all the testing and tuning work to our benefit.  this motor can easily produce 300hp without spending much cash or making a ton of noise.at atco raceway when 300 z's and g's from several forums got together i raced a coupe with 20 more hp out of the showroom.  i have just the plenum and a lightweight pulley.  he got a 14.7 @ 94 in the 1/4 at 59 degrees with 39% humidity.  he has a 6 speed and lauched rather well.  i have an auto and ran a 14.2 at 97+.  other sedan auto's were running 15's and even a 16.  as for the saabs yes that is a great mod car if you dont mind cranking up the turbo boost - same with audi 1.8's...but who wants to buy a new turbo...talking to a n/a freak here.
2111,"May 24, 2004  5:01PM",fjm1,"uh oh, self proclaimed member of the 300 hp club!  ;-)  kidding aside, thanks for the info.i don't want to speak for dave but i think the point was that just a plenum is not going to get a g35 sedan owner 40hp (260 vs 300).  i'd be skeptical that your setup is at 300.  close maybe, but the vq ain't like uncorking some v8 where minor bolt-ons yield staggering #'s.i would say that 10-15 whp is a reasonable claim.  won't catch me tinkering under the hood until the warranty expires.  260 hp is still plenty fast for me."
2112,"May 24, 2004  5:42PM",chrisboth,"i have no idea what my hp is but i doubt the plenum is worth 40 too!  how about 20 is what we g guys expect.  that plus the pulley plus a modified air intake and a grounding kit is what gets you to about 300 or so.  hell the 350'z weight in about 300 less than my car - they run about 14.4 stock auto with 287 hp so what does a faster heavier car have on the same track same day...your guess is as good as mine but if i were betting i'd say more than 287 baby!ps the video of this race of me vs the g coupe left the guy holding the camera audibly gasping as i pulled on the coupe.  as my car hit second he was right there after second gear he was 5 lengths behind - and he has a six speed with 280 stock and was running a pop charger and z intake.  while not good for 40 hp - this is worthwhile beyond the $ paid for it and the results dont lie - email me and i can link you to the discussions.  the v-8 thing is true but don't let your past experience detract you from recognizing that if 2 cylinders of the six are choked for air as they are stock, that the modification will help in a significant way...again - this is not a tin can toy for a tiburon - this is an engine design mod!"
2113,"May 24, 2004  6:14PM",speedracer3,"i am assuming that by doing the mod, you have essentially voided your powertrain warranty, right?...or is this something that nissan endorses?"

2115,"May 24, 2004  6:41PM",chrisboth,"endorsing is a far cry from denying warranty service.  they don't need to endorse it to be legally inclined to fix my car if something breaks and that specific mods didn't cause the problem.i've been down a long winding road of discovery since i bought this thing and i felt the same way as you about modding before.  hell, i've owned 5 japanse cars and until now the biggst mod i ever made was putting in speakers that didn't suck...i am not into stickers or racing on the street or being seen and heard - it's about engineering, design funtionality and making the 35k i paid for my car pay off in tinkering and improvements that dont hurt the car.  fun!  i want to own this thing for 200k miles or 10 years which ever comes first (10 years is looking good).why would a better air intake manifold setup hurt the car? if the intake plenum itself goes then you get a new one from doug...and the only ones to go have been covered by him even though they were all fi induced blowouts of the plenum at the weld points - yer talking 450 hp cars here!given that you have effectively improved the car, lets hope you didn't drop any bolts or dirt into the intake runners...  if the day you put the plenum on the car doesn't work becasue you didn't install it correctly - you're on your own.  but if you put the plenum on and there is a problem with your air flow sensor or the exhaust manifold cracks - well they would have to prove that your mod casued the problem.  casue and effect are hard for them to come up with in the most clear cut cases.  the mm act is a good one to get to know.  it puts the burden of proof on the dealer.  proven effective mods that dont harm the engine from reputable race teams or proven mod experts is harmless fun to me.  is there risk - sure.  but a better design like a plenum that offers better airflow and less air fuel ratio differential for each cylinder (or more even distribution of the same air) is not going to casue you any problems (dont take my word for it call doug or think physics).  this is no where near the modification level of a forced induction system or something that makes the engine work hotter, faster, more...this makes it work more efficiently with the existing conditions - ala the better gas mileage.adding 40 hp tp this car is not going to hurt it one iota.  studying the vq for the last few months while researching the viability of lightweight underrive crank pulley i learned that the vq may be the most naturally balanced and most durable engine ever built with 6 holes.  from the cylinder bank angle to the internal balancing to the tranny that handles 340hp in a v-8 platform from the q...it all adds up to me no longer worrying about things that wont hurt my engine.  the worst thing i ever did was a cold air intake and i may put that back on if my girlfriend stops driving it!"
2116,"May 24, 2004  6:43PM",speedracer3,"kd,well, if it was done with nismo parts and done at a nissan sanctioned facility you would be ok.chris,you'd be surprised how manufacturers find any excuse to strip you of your warranty. sometimes any mod, weather related to the warranty repair or not is enough for them to deny you warranty coverage. you shouldn't have a problem with the vq, because it is a very sturdy engine, but just in case, be prepared to fight if you go to your infiniti dealership for warranty repair that relates to engine or tranny."
2117,"May 24, 2004  6:48PM",chrisboth,my dealer actually installed the crank pulley for me.  there has never been a case where a pulley casued a vq motor to fail.  when i show up at the dealer the techs come running to see what i'v been working on and many are incorporating my mods into thier own maxima's and g's.  many dealers sell the pulley and many have installed the plenum (not mine).  some infiniti dealership will give you a hard time as they are not mod friendly...a hard time is easliy overcome with knowledge about your rights as a consumer.  i get bs from service providers all the time about things they think they cant do.   a little knowledge always overcomes ignorance and people looking for an excuse to not work or cover the warranty.

2126,"May 25, 2004  1:07PM",chrisboth,1)  there is no possible way a dealer will attribute a non moving part to any detontation or worst case you can dream of.  it's not that hard to make a plenum if you are an expert.  don't be scared there are hundreds and thousands who taken the leap based on other poeple being the guinea pig.  to be clear i run no risk for this or any mod i have chosen in terms of dealer warranty issues - this is not a twin turbo install.2)  you dont believe it because you attribute a 40% increase in mileage to what.  i say the sudden blip in mileage the day after i got the plenum speaks for itself and the 2500 others with excel spreadsheets and milage charts...sha.  what do you think better/more air does to your car - effeciency come to my mind and better gas mileage would come from that as a default.  is your denial based on the 3 series having few mods like this?3)  i increase the reliablity by doing two things a)  lightening the load on my crank with a lite weight pulley and b) improving and eqaulizing the airflow distribution to all intake runners.i've been studying the physics on these for a while.  i dont proclaim power numbers for the sake of it without a dyno chart but you can see them from other's with the same exact mods on more enthusiastic car specific forums for yourself.  those 2 mnods are worht 30hp.

2128,"May 25, 2004  4:20PM",chrisboth,i wont try and convince you but i wont let other g owner be steered astray by falsities or misinformation.most mods that improve performance also improve gas mileage if they relate to a/f ratio increases.  if i put a plenum on my car and the air flow is better and my a/f ratio is better the effect is a more effecient car.  if you suggest that i can get 4 mpg only from my dreams then perhaps once you have some expereince in modding cars lightly you can join my dream.  if you haven;t modded a car you may not understand that air is your friend and air is free.  it contains the o2 that powers the little pistons with the help of a detonating catalyst (petrol).  the more air in the ratio the more power is extracted given a fixed amount of fuel.i have a hard time seeing where you miss this but look at it this way.  if the a/f ratio is 10 to 1 stock and i put a mod on that gets me 12 to 1 (which most intake mods do add air!) the results are more power which = less work for the motor for the same loads and speeds = better gas milage.  most people driving modded g's are there reporting 25-29.  most stock ones are 17-23.  not scientific study but not it's rocket science either.

2135,"May 25, 2004  7:37PM",speedracer3,"getting back to the point. the vq is a very tunable engine, it is no wonder that nissan literally uses it in nearly its entire product line. nissan has varied the hp rating by applying minor tweaks to the engine or exhaust system. you are living proof that getting more juice out of the vq can be done inexpensively in the aftermarket world as well. as we discussed, the risk is being denied warranty service if something goes wrong. solution is either have 1)a good dealer 2) a good mechanic. as to your rant about why companies don't give you the maximum potential in your engine, go figure. my audi 1.8t with the right chip program can generate 200hp. why do they give a measly 170hp?..my thought, so they don't trounce their v6s."

2449,"July  6, 2004  4:12PM",chrisboth,kd the steptronic is great at everything but keeping you from owning a dog when you wanted a cat.  the auto makes an otherwise very strong motor seem less enthusiastic and frankly slow.  the manual is a very nice compliment to the straight six.  the auto saps power somehow so while nice and smooth it's less than desirable to many who dont want to sacrifice performance because they live in the northeast.

"" you pretty much abuse the notion that the thing helps fuel efficiency what is your explanation for 15 hp?""i already explained that.  plenum restriction does have an impact for high rpm wide-open throttle operation.  this is normal and expected.    there are lots of dyno graphs that illustrate this--often airflow enhancement hurts power at lower rpm's.  counterintuitive, but that's how it works.  i found some interesting g35 dyno charts with the crawford plenum, but unfortunately i can't link to them due to town hall rules.  according to them, even 15hp is optimistic.  but i'm not arguing about power, just the idea that increasing airflow is going to incrase economy.  it just doesn't work that way.  your engine is *supposed* to be starved when cruising on the highway.  that's the point of a throttle.  a lot of people seem to assume that increasing one aspect of efficiency ( power ) is going to positively impact another aspect ( fuel economy ).  they're often different issues--but not always of course--reducing internal friction would improve both.  but thinking that anything that increases power is going to increase fuel economy is like thinking that anything that helps me run faster is also going to help me bench more.  not necessarily, or even often, the case.  dave"

2541,"July 16, 2004  2:54PM",fjm1,"i&#146;ve owned both a 3&#146;er sedan with sport suspension and now own a g sedan with sport suspension. i try to autocross at least once per year, finnally getting the g on the track. when i was in germany the bmw went to hockenheim and nurburgring.  i will say right now that the bmw has a better balance of firmness and compliance in everyday driving.  but these are my on track observations.the bmw will hit precisely on the marks lap after lap. the bmw understeers. slow speed corners can be a challenge because the chassis must be &#147;flicked&#148; into the corner.  by this i mean as you come into a slow (sub 30 mph) tight corner the balance of the bmw must be purposely upset to allow for better rotation of the nose.  normally this can be done with the throttle on most rear drivers but the bmw tucks it&#146;s tail and digs during wot corner exit.  the suspension in the bmw is better at soaking up track irregularities.  mid corner bumps don&#146;t usually cause you to run wide or have to lift for fear of rotation.  bmw sport suspension handles multiple corners like s-curves very well.  threshold braking is linear with zero fade.  the bmw is surgical, precise, capable and unflappable.having said all that about the bmw the g is ultimately more capable mostly because of more power.  it takes a better driver than me to wring out everything the g has to offer. the g takes a few more course corrections. the g is easier to modulate with the throttle.  the g can be coaxed to drift easier and superior torque can make for terrifying exit speeds. i can run out of track and talent with the g&#146;s go pedal.  tight corners can be dispatched easily with a touch of throttle-on oversteer.   track irregularities can upset the g&#146;s chassis during threshold braking and the rear can definitely step out on fast sweepers.  the g does not transition very well during multi-corner maneuvers.   there is more bobbing as the dampers fight to control pitch and roll.  once the g is set though it&#146;s time to dial in the throttle and rocket.  the g is powerful, visceral, involved, and ultimately more rewarding to drive fast.  on a road course i believe a novice driver could drive a bmw and post better times than in a g.  a skilled driver in a g would post better times than in a bmw.  for me, it would probably be a wash depending on the length of the straightaway.  ultimately, i enjoy both cars greatly and am fortunate to have owned both and gotten to test each cars limits within a safe, controlled environment."

(based on the vin, they had it booked at $29,625 - retail - and $25,775 - trade-in.) before i do anything nuts, i thought i'd ask a few questions . . .1. the car has 27,000 miles on it, so it still has a ways to go on the warranty. anyone have any experience with mb dealerships on how willing they are are to honor warranty issues from second or third owners of the vehicle?2. there seem to be lots of questions about quality on this board. i know it's annoying when a quality vehicle gives you grief but it also sounds like the vehicles under warranty are getting problems fixed without too much trouble. am i right or am i missing something?3. i gotta know more about the cell phone thing. my guess is that it will only work with a specific mb approved, cell phone provider, right? there's no way to get my us cellular number to work with this thing is there?4. any other advice from those of you who have bought a used mb c-class vehicle?thanks for your help!peter"

2558,"August  6, 2004 12:33AM",bmbmw,"greetings all... i have been following this board for over a year and have found the discussions both interesting and insightful. this fall i intend to purchase either a new ('05) 240 (elegance) or bmw 325i. i have only owned and driven corolla's in the past, on average keeping them 12 years...they have only ever been great cars. in terms of reliability, they are my standard. but i'm ready to try something more upscale now and after a fair amount of research it has come down to the 2 fine cars mentioned above. i intend to keep my next car for 10 years, i will only put low(city) mileage on it, will get the extended warranty and expect to pay it off within 1 year. my first choice (or the choice of my heart) would be the 240, but i am concerned about the recent consumer reports ratings of the car. i know that the 01 and 02 years are of greater concern on this. how has the reliability been for those who bought '03 and '04 model years?i guess my close 2nd choice (or the choice of my head) would be the bmw... its a little more sports sedan (i'm more of a touring sedan type myself)and it has very high ratings from most automotive sources... at any rate i would appreciate your thoughts, thank you...b"

2562,"August  6, 2004  2:15PM",kyfdx,"from anecdotal evidence i would say the bmw will be cheaper to maintain than the mercedes.  if you keep it for ten years, resale isn't that important, but if you do happen to get rid of it earlier, the 3-series will hold its value better than the c-class.something that might sway you..  bmw will soon be offering manufacturer extended warranties that bump the coverage to 6yr/100k miles and you can also extend the ""free"" maintenance coverage to match that time period.  the extended warranty is $2249 and the extended maintenance plan is $995.  except for future price increases, you can buy that coverage for the same price at any time before your original warranty and maintenance plan run out.i wouldn't discount the bmw, just because you are a ""touring"" type of person..   just stay away from the sport package.  one of the 3-series strengths is how well it combines handling with a good ride.regards,kyfdx"

2595,"August 17, 2004  9:06PM",buddhabman,"http://motoring.iafrica.com/carsinaction/shootout/291844.htmok let me throw in the 328 and 330. ;-).  i have worked over 325's in the canyons of la with an old style legacy. i mean neutral handling feel, grip.  the us legacy has always been a chassis in search of a motor.  the japan and euro spec legacies have always been known for their driving experience."
2596,"August 17, 2004  9:24PM",kyfdx,"yeah.. and in the '80s, you could get an amc reliance gta that had more grip than a corvette, due to its tire/wheel set-up.  would i compare them? no, but someone would...  would i want one over a corvette?  no again.can boris said outdrive me even in a geo metro?  probably, but i still wouldn't buy one.regards,kyfdx(who really likes subarus)"
2597,"August 17, 2004  9:28PM",kdshapiro,"seriously, when i get the impression the legacy takes over the title of the best sports sedan, i'll get it. but first, it has to dethrone the tl.i think it's great the a new legacy can finally beat a 6 year old bmw design. honestly, i think the upcoming twin turbo three series should just about change the equation. but i can here it now....""what about the value"""
2598,"August 17, 2004  9:38PM",buddhabman,"i am still waiting for the comparos to come.  i really like the tl, but it's match with the legacy is coming .  what did bmw put out their ""new"" 5 series with a hidden 6 year old design.  bangle had some stuff in the can i guess?  look i like the 3 series and the tl a bunch.  the dude before owes it to himself to drive all the great choices out there of which the legacy is one of the best. hey, if you don't like subie's, hey more power to you.  %-)"
2599,"August 17, 2004  9:52PM",kdshapiro,"bmw as never about 0-60. yes the offer rockets, but it's about a balance of luxury and sportiness and driver connection with the road.actually the ""dude"" can do what he wants. he may be like me and know his next car is either german or american. lot's of great choices from both sides, but i'm skipping japan this time around.if you want to convince yourself the new legacy is a ""better"" car than the 5 series, go for it.i'll be more than happy to let you blow past me."
2600,"August 17, 2004 10:34PM",dhanley,"while i think the comparison with the 9-5 areo makes  sense--i think the areo is a great car, comparing it and a 530to a subaru gt really doesn't work.  if we're choosing ""any"" sedean based on grip and power, carsdirect can get me a 6-speed gto for $31,190 .  it even beats the legacy's combined 21mpg, too ( when both use stick ).  this is still ""luxury performance"" and there's more to that than 0-60 times.  dave"
2601,"August 17, 2004 10:38PM",buddhabman,"i agree, the point is not 0-60, it is driving feel, connection to the road and experience. the bmw has always excelled at the crosshairs of sportiness and luxury. you can keep on convincing yourself that no other car compares, but this new legacy like the acura tl and the g35 is finally doing the same.  now comparing the legacy to the 5 series is a huge stretch, as admitted in the article referenced. but it just goes to point to the significance of the legacy."
2602,"August 17, 2004 10:47PM",buddhabman,"yes the aero is nice(2003 aero wagon owner) . it needs stiffer springs to be a true canyon carver, but overall it is pretty under appreciated. go test drive a legacy gt limited. you will be surprised at the interior.  i have my disappoinments with it though. it doesn't have nav or the onstar that was removed.  it also needs backup sensors and hid's, although the projector beams are bright enough.  people we are talking middle class everymans, percieved luxury. there is not a whole lot of differnce in the materials of all these cars including the subaru now.  i know the legacy was tossed out of this discussion a while back as i campaigned for it's inclusion. so i will bow out.  i kind of feel like stem cell supporters at the republican convention."
2603,"August 17, 2004 11:07PM",kdshapiro,"okay last comment of mine. perceived luxury there is no such thing. perceived luxury=perceived value of house. the wrx has been compared to a $100,000 porsche in the mags. does that make it so? i have never heard anybody say in real life - porsche - $70k= wrx.in order to be considered an entry level luxo, not a perceived entry level luxo, the i's have to be dotted and the t's have to be crossed. it's inside and well as outside.while magazine reviews never enter into my buying decisions, they are good for trends and informational sources.when the entry level luxo list list for sports sedans is:* bmw, acura, infiniti, caddy, subaru, saab etc, and the subaru comes out on top, that's when i'll note them to be given their due."
2604,"August 17, 2004 11:18PM",cdnpinhead,some nerves have been touched.is it easier to make the cheap guys good or the good guys cheap?appears some of the cheap guys are working to get better.  i'm not going to hold my breath for the other piece of it.
2605,"August 18, 2004  2:12AM",kdshapiro,"the car market has substantially changed over the last 10-15 years. the expensive guys are going after the less expensive turf, the less expensive turf players are looking to get into the more expensive turf.saying either camp is/will be successful is a matter of time to understand if the effort is successful. somehow just as many pot-shots have been taken on both sides as so far the product produced.seems like there are just as many nerves touched on one side as the other, as we all have our respective opinions. only time will tell. as bmw completes it's product announcements over the next couple of years, it will be an interesting time for them.i don't think all car manufacturers won't know until about 2007-2008 if their transformation has been on target."
2606,"August 18, 2004  5:20AM",dhanley,"don't know if you mean me, i just didn't want to rehash all the ""what belongs in the topic"" discussion. if you want to post a ""is the 2005 legacy a luxury car?"" topic, i'll read it; it ought to be interesting. i look forward to both highline models becoming more affordable, and affordable models becoming more highline.  i figure that, either way, we win.there is a volvo dealer very close to me, and i admit the new s40 is growing on me.  if there really is a 300hp awd version in the works, that ought to be interesting."

2608,"August 18, 2004  3:15PM",dhanley,"i agree that you want tractable power ( my bmw salesman thinks the z3 3.0l was more fun than the z3m in most situations ), not just power, but to me 300hp is not ""nothing."" it's overkill to the point of frustration for 99% of driving.  i find cars like the vette sort of fustrating because not only can you not use all the power, but you can hardly wind the engine up without getting arrested.  basically the s40r would have the same drivetrain as the s60r : http://www.edmunds.com/new/2004/volvo/s60r/100278288/roadtestarti- cle.html?articleid=101293 but in a smaller more nimble car.dave"

""balance shafts"" ? sounds familiar. i checked both my 2001 9-3 & 9-5 owner's manuals and found that both cars were equipped with 2 balance shafts at that time. i am not sure when saab put those in their cars.i remembered i asked an audi salesperson whether the auto tranny of an a4 can learn the driver's driving style (adaptive transmission ??) and he told me no. i think saab has some nice and unique features that they didn't mention to people. not that many people know saab came up the idea of headlight wipers, heated seats, etc. the marketing dept should be responsible for that.now 9-3 is more mainsteam. maybe most people like it better than the old one. i missed the hatch. it needs something more than 210hp. saab should create something like the viggen with awd for the 9-3 (i heard there will be a 9-3 sport hatch but awd may not be an option)."
2678,"September 16, 2004  5:06AM",dhanley,"hmm--that was how i felt about the '900 i used to have.  that car had lots of great features with a few glaring oversights/shortcomings.  i also had the bmw then, which had fewer ""gee, neat"" features and less utility ( hatch, interior room ) but no real shortcomings i cared about.  for example, the bmw engine didn't have that hammer-you-into the seat torque blast, with that cool motorcycle sound, but it didn't have the turbo lag either.  the saab was sort of a headache and i chose to keep the bmw but i miss that car in general.i recently seriously considered getting either a 9-3 or a 9-5.  i really like them both but each had something that made me say ""wait"" although i was contemplating pulling the trigger in each case, once with a 9-5 aero ( used, 3000 miles ) and the other time with a new arc.  both manual transmission.  the 9-5's bane was handling/turbo lag and the 9-3's was the el cheapo gm interior.  both could be fixed, of course.  i think simply sticking the ecotec in the 9-5 would improve it a lot; it's a lighter smaller engine ( for better weight distribution) with less turbo lag.  the ecotec is also smoother.  another thing that irked me is the nature of the turbo with stick.   you have to shift really fast or boost is largely lost between shifts.  it's find if you're driving ""all out"" but not so great for maneuvers in traffic.  sort of the opposite of the gto my cousin wants me to get.     even with my bmw i can start moving without using the gas, just easing in the clutch, while i felt quite choppy in both the saabs when starting off.  the lack of the hatch also miffed me.  still, i'd rather have a car i really like with a few bugs than a car that is mostly ""reliable.""  kind of like dating the awesome girl with a few issues vs miss boring.  and there's something about the saab that i at least want to like.  the new s40 really intrigues me.  it seems to have impressive environmental credentials, which i know a lot of you probably don't care about that much so i'll shut up about that.  dave"

2688,"September 24, 2004  2:36PM",gordonwd,"i&#146;ve had my &#146;04 325i for about 5 months now, so i feel qualified to evaluate it and compare it to my previous car, a &#146;98 audi a4 1.8t. these cars are similarly equipped, manual trans, non-sport package with all-seasons, about the same size and performance category, so a comparison seems fair at this point.engine &#150; well, the 325 is rated at 35hp over the a4, so it&#146;s pretty much no contest. the engine is also smoother and really begs to be revved. the audi would spool up pretty well, too, but i always felt like i was straining it a bit. i am also not sorry to lose the turbo, as i have always felt they add complexity under the hood that could be a long-term problem. in fact, the only major repair that i had to pay for on the a4 was a $500+ turbo-related issue.transmission &#150; pretty even here with both being 5-speeds. the audi had a bit softer of a clutch vs. the bmw&#146;s abruptness. i am only now at the point where i can consistently make a really smooth 1-2 shift.handling &#150; this is my first rwd car in many years, and i forgot how different it feels. the crisp turn-in is especially noticeable, and the steering overall has better feel than the a4. ride-wise, the cars are pretty comparable: well controlled, firm but never harsh over rough pavement, typically german. the one thing the a4 had going for it was of course the quattro awd. one of my favorite things to do (you&#146;re never too old to be immature) was to out-drag someone at a stoplight on wet pavement. i could pretty well mash the pedal to the floor coming out and the car would just go, leaving the other guy spinning his front (or rear) wheels. even with traction control on a rwd or fwd, you&#146;re not going to beat awd in slippery conditions.interior &#150; audi is known for interior design and the a4 did have very nice styling and controls layout. the bmw is not as well coordinated, but is a bit more business-like in its appearance. however, i like my particular color combination better than the a4&#146;s. the sand leatherette along with black floormats and dash, set off by the premium wood trim, makes for a nice look as opposed to the a4 that was all gray with some silver trim pieces. the leatherette in the bmw is also a bit nicer-appearing than the a4&#146;s.the automatic climate control on the bmw is not quite as good at regulating temperature and air movement as the audi&#146;s. the fan seems to blow too high in some conditions and not fast enough in others. the audi definitely had the best auto-temp control that i have experienced.exterior &#150; at the time that i picked out my a4, it was the e36 that i compared it against and i thought the a4 was better looking. but ever since the e46 came out the next year, my eye was always drawn to them when i spied one. i still think, though, that the a4 has classic good looks that i prefer to the newer model that was released in &#146;01. likewise i expect that i will still prefer the e46 after the e90 comes out.radio &#150; no contest here: the audi had a much superior standard radio. on a few occasions, i&#146;ve wondered if the cds that i&#146;m playing in the bmw are the same ones that i used to play in the a4.intangibles &#150; i am not a status seeker, but from the reaction of many people that i know i can see that the bmw nameplate carries a lot more prestige than most others. everyone knows what a bmw is, whereas i think that audi is less known and tends to get lumped with other second-tier european cars. there is something about seeing that roundel on the steering wheel that makes me feel extra good about my choice.sumup &#150; the 325i feels like a small performance sedan with luxury appointments and options; the a4 is more of a small luxury sedan that performs well. and there you have it (my opinion of course)."

2695,"October 19, 2004  1:32AM",jamesspot,"we just went from car to car. they had info posters highlighting the specs of each of the automobiles. lexus was amazingly fair in their presentation of all the cars. the class groupings had the is300 with the g35 and the 330i, the es330 (which i didn't drive) was grouped with the c320 and the tl.the g35 and is300 are low 30's cars, while a 330i step with premium package and the c320 are pushing 40k.the is300 did have traction control, i didn't know whether it had lsd or not.i agree - the 325i is an even match for the is300 price wise, the 330i is a much more expensive and capable car.since the event was for the general public invited by lexus marketing, automatics were the only game in town for every car there. i think i was invited as i went to the lexus web site and a dealership when i was looking at cars in the spring. it did make me want to drive my car on the course!"

2795,"November 13, 2004  9:47PM",designman,"alright, i have to throw in two cents to keep this place honest.i used to live in 10,000 feet up in the colorado rockies. at first i was intimidated by the thought of snow storms and compromises with mobility. then i quickly realized that the snow crews are nothing like nyc areas where you sometimes have to wait a day to have roads cleared. in dem dere mountains snow barely had a chance to touch the ground before they would clear the roads (the more populated areas anyway). my brother lived in montreal and it&#146;s pretty much the same way. so it seems to me that one&#146;s daily conditions play a role when considering winter driving equipment. if you can whisk your way onto clear roads and highway, the risk of getting marooned is considerably lower.  i often find myself on lots of hills with plenty of deep stuff and/or ice. i know a thing or two about getting by with two wheels, but nothing beats awd in snow&#151;nothing. never even came close to having a snag. you have to use more skill and savvy with the others, like taking circuitous routes home, maintaining momentum into a hill or driving uphill backwards. not many people would think of these things. i agree that all-season tires are not the way to go with rwd and fwd. they have mostly summer-tire characteristics and i would only use them with awd. even then, they compromise traction, braking and handling in snow.bottom line here. driving in snow with rwd and fwd is like jogging with florsheim wingtips. sure, you can do it. but a g35x, 325xi or anything else like this is a great choice.   shipo, your mom should be proud of you&#151;i see nothing wrong with that sentence. i would imagine however that she wouldn&#146;t approve of your 100 mph jaunts ;-) you ca people must me totally bored with this stuff. questiondoes santa claus go to places like san diego? indeed, i envy you."

2798,"November 14, 2004 12:23AM",shipo,"hmmm, i gotta disagree with you about some if this.  i regularly drive two fwd cars and one rwd car shod with winter tires, and i think that there is little comparison, the rwd car seems to have significantly better traction in all driving regimens.  so, based upon that, i would suggest a slight change to your chart for traction (i assume we are only talking about acceleration here):1) awd w/winter tires2) awd w/all-season tires*3) rwd w/winter tires*4) fwd w/winter tires5) fwd w/all-season tires6) rwd w/all-season tires* i'm not completely convinced that the awd car with all-seasons would be of any advantage over the rwd car with winter tires.then again there are the issues of handling and braking, and if i remember the results of the side-by-side test performed by an auto magazine several years ago using cars as nearly matched as possible (mb e320 4-matic, mb e320 rwd, audi a6 quattro, audi a6 fwd) the results shifted more in favor of the winter tire shod rwd car.  in fact, if i'm not mistaken, in the braking department, the rwd car easily won due to its inherently more neutral front/rear weight distribution (especially compared to the fwd a6) combined with its (relatively) lighter weight (compared to the two awd cars).personally, i am willing to give up some ""go power"" to gain some ""stop power"", hence my comment that i believe that a rwd car (especially one with a near neutral weight distribution) shod with winter tires offers the best driving experience for winter driving.  that said, if i lived in a mountainous area such as the rockies, i would certainly opt for the awd car simply because on a steep enough hill, the fwd/rwd car simply ain't gonna start moving from a standing stop while the awd car will move away from the stop with relative aplomb.  ;-)best regards,shipo"

2814,"November 21, 2004  8:29AM",velostic,"i test drove the cts with high hopes as i love the way the bigger caddies handle and like the looks of the cts. i was disappointed. for me, it was draggy, bumpy and the steering/handling wasn't at all like the larger models. just my opinion, i know others love theirs, but if you're looking for a caddie drive in a less expensive, smaller body, the cts is a non-starter. i understand they are coming out with a v8 very soon."
2815,"November 24, 2004  4:06AM",cdost1,"folks,i am kind of stuck and could use some help.  i am trying to do the pros and cons of a 325xi, g35x and a tl.  i live in the northeast so the awd would be nice but not a necessity.  i drove all 3 cars was leaning toward the bmw but it seems a bit underpowered vs the other 2 in the decision set.  am i making a mountain out of a mole hill or is should this be a concern.also i heard from some folks that the tl tends to develop some rattles reasonable quickly after purchase.  thanks for any counsel."
2816,"November 24, 2004  1:19PM",m4d_cow,"rattles: as far as i heard its true w/ the previous tl, but i never heard of such complaint with the new tl the 325xi might seem a bit underpowered, but its all about your preferences. with g35x you'll get the power but sacrifice the comfort and luxury due to its harsh ride and low quality materials. th tl has both power and comfort for $33k, quite a decent offer. if power is on top of your list, the g is worthy, but if you want luxury along w/ it you might wanna consider the bmw or the tl. hope this helps"

2818,"November 24, 2004  1:31PM",sevenfeet0,"velostic, with all due respect, you're missing the point of the cts.  this car was never designed to look, drive or handle like the larger models, especially the deville or the old outgoing seville.  i for one am very happy that this car is nowhere near the handling, road feel or performance or my old deville.also, the cts already has a v8 model..the hot rod cts-v.  there is no indication that there will be any other kind of v8 version of this car in non-hot rod form."

2820,"November 26, 2004 12:55AM",cdost1,thanks for your response.i am curious about your comment on the low quality materials on the g35x.  would you be able to elaborate a bit ?this car for me is about being fun to drive. our other car is a 2004 acura mdx which acts as family wagon.  i need the practicality of a sedan but beyond that i want something that will perform well and be a fun ride and age well.  my boss has a 325 and says it drives with 100k miles like it was new. i have had great luck with 3 nissan's so just when i was about to eliminate the g35x i decided to keep it in the mix.thanks again for your insight
2821,"November 26, 2004  2:44AM",brew99,"i went through a similar decision last year and ended up with the tl.  not sure how much snow you get where you are but the front wheel drive of the tl handles the white stuff quite well.  the car is definitely fun to drive and the at version does not have any real torque steer to be concerned with.  i reaaly liked the performance characteristics of the g35 but could not warm up to the interior.  the 330 was a little out of my price range and the general small interior size of the 3 series also did not work for me.  all 3 are great vehicles however, enjoy the decision making process."
2822,"November 26, 2004  2:29PM",cdost1,"brew,thanks much.  just when i think i am leaning in one direction i get a note like yours and i am back to undecided.  i think the 330 is going to be out of my range also but i figured i would at least check it out.  as far as the snow goes i am in northern nj so some winters are real bad some not so much. need the fwd or awd for piece of mind though.  i have rwd suv now and i buying this car because the suv is a tobaggan in the snow.one question.  i have read in another forum about a problem with vibration on the tl at highway speeds 55 - 60 mph.  have you had any experience with this ?again thanks for the counsel.cdost1"

(i couldnt find any about trans failure on tl'04, is this for real?  but more on bmw3'04, g35'04 and especially the es'04)   i'm going to test drive the g35 this afternoon and 330/325 later on. i'm hoping that g35 is the one. i love that sexy looking car.   one question though, i read some post that the g35x is not as fast as the g35 and i also heard the 6mt has problems with it's transmission. according to some, infiniti just hasnt issued a recall unless more people complain.  is there any other things that i should look at (i understand that the interior is probably the cheapest among the other 3 but i can live with that)?    thanks, darren"
2872,"December 28, 2004  7:32PM",riez,"darrenw...  if you are looking at bmw 325i or 330i and you looked at the lexus es330, you should consider the lexus is300.  both 325i and is300 are rwd and similar in size.   the is300 has consistently scored well with consumer reports, jd powers, and intellichoice.  and its crash test results for nhtsa and iihs have been very good.  lexus has better standard warranty though bmw has ""free"" maintenance.  believe lexus' extended warranty is much less expensive than bmw's."
2873,"December 29, 2004  4:13AM",cdost1,"folks, saw all the posts.  i will try to answer them as succintly as possible.   i eliminated the the tl pretty quickly.  liked the drive not that crazy about the look.  (i just bought an mdx two months ago.) first on my quotes.  the best i could do on the 325xi in nj was 36,299.  on the 330xi 40,299.  these quotes included premium pkg, leather, upgraded stereo auto transmission, wood trim.  the quotes came from 2 different dealers jmk (325xi) flemington (330xi).  i don't think the mats are typically included in the bmw pricing but i did not really haggle here since i ended up purchasing a g35x. after driving all 3 cars i decided on the infiniti.  i think i liked the tighter handling of the bmw but the 325xi just seemed way underpowered compared to a g35x.  this just was my feel.  i am sure a bmw loyalist would argue i don't know what i am talking about but that is what it felt like to me.  the 330xi would have been great.  more power than the 325xi and tighter than the g35x but i could not rationalize the additional $6500 in price for a car with less backseat and room with a 3 year old.  i saw the posts on the rwd and really cannot comment since i wanted an awd and only drove them. again speed and power seemed relative and a rwd was not in the decision set. the g35x felt nice to me. (my last 2 cars were maximas)  it handled nicely and had plenty of pep.  believe it or not it seemed to run quieter than the 325xi as well.   the last thing is i have had 3 nissan's and none of them owed me anything when i gave them up (all with 8 - 10 years and 150k+ miles).  that was the final factor. i am picking it up tomorrow and assuming i do not jerked around at the last minute my 2005 g35x will cost $34,250 with premium c pkg, full size spare and wood trim. the only thing not in here is tt&l.  splash guards are not available at the moment on the 2005 g35x. i hopes this helps everyone. if i have any surprises i will chime back in. regards, craig"
2874,"December 29, 2004  7:58PM",darrenw,"thanks for the replies guys,   i test drove the g35 yesterday,  after i started the car, i 've noticed some rattle noises (chattering gear noise) when launching from a stop.   it seemed coming from the drivetrain.  i asked the salesman, he said it's normal because the engine was cold.   i couldnt help looking at the rim, there was a lot of brake dust. how long do they last(brakes)?  is there any way to improve the ride on the car? road and engine noise, vibration and stiff suspension.   but everything else was perfect, except for interior and audio which i dont really care so much.   i loved its handling and imo its one of the best looking cars.  i told my wife, that i didnt want to go to any other place but she insisted to go to a bmw dealership.  apparently she didnt like the ride. well...tough luck charlie, i just didnt want to upset her.   went to a bimmer dealership, and test drove a 325i.   the car was too small for us and wasnt powerful enough compared to the g35 although it rode slightly better than the g, tighter handling and better interior/audio. i guess 325 is out of the picture.  anyway i decided to test drive the 330i. it felt more powerful than the 325 but not the g35.   has anyone noticed the wind noise, tougher ride/vibration (slightly better than the g), and somehow weak? power steering? or was it just that car?  the car was smaller and a lot more expensive.   i understand that sporty ride means stiffer suspension, i just wish my wife does too   i wanted to go back to the infiniti dealership again. a funny thing happened, the salesman was upset when i asked about his opinion on acura tl. have to admit, it made me curious.   riez, thanks for the suggestion but i think the is is too small for us. but i'm sure its a good car.   tommorow i need to go to another g35 and acura dealership. hope i can get it before the year end,  some said its the best time to buy a car!   thanks for the info cdost1, greatly appreciated, i might go with the rwd.   is it true that the cars mpg is not that good? how bad can it be?   anyway have a good time and enjoy your new car, buddy!   m4d_cow, eventhough i'm almost convinced that i'll go with the g35 but it doesnt hurt to test drive the tl. have to buy it by friday.  (unless the tl has less vibration/ wind noise/ engine noise, handle as good as the g/3's, faster than 330, better mpg and softer ride)     thanks for your help."
2875,"December 30, 2004  4:43AM",fedlawman,"my opinion of the tl is that, using your references, it handles significantly better than the es330, but it's not as sharp as the g35.    on the other hand, the tl rides significantly better than the g35, but it's not as creamy as the es330.   it may turn out to be the perfect sport/comfort mix you're looking for - plus, it's interior materials and layout are a couple notches above the g35."
2876,"December 30, 2004  4:57AM",fedlawman,"just in case anyone was wondering, here's an update on my tsx relationship... yes i still enjoy the car very much. however, in spite of the fact that it's made car and driver's ""ten best list"" for two straight years now, my initial impressions are proving to be true. after 18 months of ownership, the thrill is starting to fade. yes, i know - it has a gorgeous cockpit, peppy acceleration, and nimble handling, but like all honda's...it's lack of ""soul"" is beginning to take it's toll on me. i might start modding it (summer tires, rear sway bar, coil-overs, i-h-e) to make it sportier and add some personality, or i may finally get serious about leaving this segment behind (do i really want to be here?) and replace it with something more sporting and less luxurious. a '95ish porsche 911, a '98ish bmw m3, or perhaps a brand-new mitsubishi evo rs - they're all on my mind. any thoughts/opinions?"

""a friend of mine bought a $50k used porsche on-line, after his experience, i would never do something like that."" this is a dealer, not some guy selling online. i bought my miata by finding it online, then going to the dealer, who was a couple of hundred miles away. full factory warranty (4 years/50k miles)would be in effect as well. i certainly wouldn't be fearful of a car with 851 miles on it."
2883,"December 30, 2004  5:19PM",kdshapiro,"not to voice an opinion to the contrary but gas mileage estimates mean nothing. a friend of mine drives a vette in the same traffic pattern i do. 15mpg average mileage. yeah they get good mileage going downhill with a tail-wind in the right traffic conditions.   but otoh it's only 1 mpg less than the estimates. however by nature i would not consummate this type of sale for a used car, that's why i don't buy demos. but that's me."

2964,"January 25, 2005  7:34PM",dhanley,have you driven the cts and tl back to back?
2965,"January 25, 2005 10:15PM",laurasdada,"but that's just on the aesthetic level.  have you checked out the interior of a cts?  does the c stand for chevy cavalier???  and the exterior, while differnt, is just plain overdone.  imho, of course.  i haven't driven the cts, which is probably its saving grace, but even if it ""outdrives"" the tl (which i find to be very handome in and out), i could not look at, nor sit in, the cts every day and be happy... drive 'em both, figure out your priorities and buy.  whichever you buy is the best car. ymmv."
2966,"January 26, 2005  4:02PM",gordonwd,"i always say ""what part of your car do you see the most of?"" well, it's the interior -- not the exterior styling, and that has always been very important to me. that's one reason why my last two cars have been a '98 a4 and a '04 325i: both look and feel very nice from the driver's seat. that is also one thing that turned me off when i test-drove a saab 9-3 before deciding on the 325. the instrument panel of the saab was very complex-looking -- dozens of buttons -- and with the display for the radio and that other display up under the windshield, it definitely didn't do it for me. i really like the external styling, and the car drove & performed well, but i couldn't see myself enjoying the view from the business seat!"
2967,"January 26, 2005  5:06PM",billykrebs,"i have driven the tl, but not the cts.  those really are the only 2 i can think of.  the g is too small, 325 is too small, the a4 is too small, the 9-3 has gotten terrible reviews. it appears that the cts is just as big as the tl.  i understand that the fit and finish is not as good in the cts.  i like the exterior styling of the cts.  one problem is that the acura dealer is 60 miles away and the cadillac dealer is 2 miles away.  that is a big deal to me.  i also am feeling pretty patriotic these days and am leaning to the cts, a car i would of never looked at a year ago. it really is tough.  on paper the acura wins and on the interior the acura wins.  i prefer the caddy exterior to the tl exterior.   the acura is cheaper on msrp as well, but i am wondering if the street price of the cts is probably much less than the msrp.  it has to be.  so, a $38k cts probably costs you $32k or so is what i am thinking.  does anyone here know? i am looking to lease, not buy so that changes things a little bit."
2968,"January 26, 2005  5:19PM",kyfdx,"1) if you like the cts exterior, that counts for something.. 2) 2 miles vs. 60 miles to the dealer is another real benefit..  3) the lease deals on tls right now are just standard rates.. no manufacturer support.. so, maybe not that great. 4) not sure of the lease deals on the cts, but something tells me, that the price difference will pretty much disappear if you are leasing.. maybe, even lower on the cts. regards, kyfdx"
2969,"January 26, 2005  5:58PM",laurasdada,"another thought, billy.  if winter driving is a consideration for you, then fwd vs. rwd may take on additional importance.  theoretically, fwd is better in the snow.  however, the non-navi tl is equipped with bridgestone turanza el42 tires which, imo, are terrible in the snow!  too bad i found this out after buying my tl, which other than the tires is a great car:  smooth, quiet, powerful and handsome inside and out.   i've not been stranded (we're getting another 8-10"" on top of the 30"" of snow we got in boston this weekend!) nor spun, but i think that is a combination of my snow driving experience and the tls traction electronics (tc, vsa, abs).  i'm somewhat upset with these tires (i think they flatspot, also)."
2970,"January 26, 2005 11:29PM",dhanley,"i had a chance to drive the tl and cts back to back on a track, and in that environment, the cts did much better.  and, you can get a lot off the msrp.  i recall seeing ads in the paper offering 6k off to begin with.   now, as a daily driver, that's not the #1 criteria, but i'm not interested in a car that doesn't make me smile.  that's just my own personal preference.  otoh this is a sport sedan topic."
2971,"January 27, 2005  2:47AM",billykrebs,"i drove the cts today for the first time.  love the exterior, the trunk, the size, the seats and the drive characteristics.  cannot stand the interior.  i cannot believe it is on the inside of a $43k car that i looked at.  i thought that the dimmer switch next to the sunroof opener was going to fall off when i touched it.  the doors are plastic, the dash is plastic, the console is plastic, the knobs are plastic, the middle console is plastic.  for as much as i love the exterior i can't believe the inside is that bad.  i am really dissapointed.  i really thought that the reviews were exaggerating how bad it is.  i am sorry to those cts owners that i am offending but i truly am surprised and disappointed.   i am the only that was that shocked by the interior.  how on earth did the cts beat the 530, a6, jag, e320 in the road and track comparison of the 6 cylinders?"
2972,"January 27, 2005  5:11AM",darrenw,"i do not own any of these vehicle, but imo 3.xl cts is not likely to be my choice of vehicles. tl wins the look, interior, power, reliability , comfort, ... well almost everything. if only tl comes with rwd  (but it handles pretty well too -imo) the g otoh has better handling (imo based on its rwd setup) but it comes with tougher ride. well, it depends on your priorities thou. but if you choose a rwder, dont forget to get winter tires (if you live in snow area). believe me you wont regret it. good luck."
2973,"January 27, 2005  4:42PM",volvodan1,"the only incentives on the cts is $1500 gm loyalty. the biggest discount we've given is $5,000 off, and that was a demo w/ 4,000 miles on it. gm has left the incentives off the cts. resale has been excellent."
2974,"January 27, 2005  6:05PM",laurasdada,"re: the interior.  i had the same reaction when i first sat in a cts at the new england auto show a few years back.  i really felt like i was in a  $20k chevy, not a (gasp) $40k caddy!   as i said earlier, the actual driving is probably (since i haven't driven one) the cts saving grace.  the exterior, while it has grown on me and isn't aztek-ugly, still is too overdone for my tastes."

2976,"January 29, 2005  8:54AM",cybersol,"have you sat in the g35 back to back with the tl? if you do, i don't see how you could come to the conclusion the g35 is small but the tl is not. they are virtually identical, except i hit my head in the rear of the tl and not the g. imo with the updated '05 g35 interior, you should definitely test drive it with your choices. it is fun to test or own any of the cars in this class. so enjoy!"
2977,"February  2, 2005  5:00PM",jrock65,"i think a g25 priced about $2500 less than the g35 would be a good idea. get more younger buyers in the door who will later upgrade to more expensive infinitis.   all the other import luxury brands offer or will offer a base version offering about 200 hp. i see no reason why infiniti should not.   audi: a4 1.8  bmw: 325i  mercedes: c240  lexus: is250 (coming soon)  acura: tsx   they could use the v6 vq25de used in the japanese fuga (u.s. m) 250gt, making 210hp at 6000rpm, and 197 torque at 4400rpm.   obviously, it won't feel as powerful as the g35, but it will have a lighter steering feel, better balance, and be more gas efficient as well.   it'll probably do 0-60 in about 7.0 seconds with auto trans, which won't be that bad."
2978,"February  2, 2005 10:39PM",billykrebs,"i did sit in the g35 and the tl back to back.  maybe i mistyped, but i think that the headroom in the tl is probably an inch or so more than the g35.  i don't necessarily think that the interior is that much different.  i am only 6'1"" but i do prefer the upright position and my head/hair was rubbing on the roof of the g35, but not on the roof of the tl or the s60 for that matter.  they are all fun you are right.  i have paralysis by analysis.  done too much research.  i should just not look at any stats and get the one that makes me feel good i guess."
2979,"February  7, 2005  2:52PM",bernardc,try real snow tires 4 of them narrow is better of course keeping same overall diameter and fitting over brake package use smaller wheel minus 1 sizing i cant believe people dont use snow tires all season are stated as for occassional light snow by tire specialist such as tire rack a set of snows on different wheels are the way to go and stop better period
2980,"February  7, 2005  5:30PM",gordonwd,"i agree that full snows are the ultimate solution, but tirerack is in business to sell tires and would like to convince you that your all-seasons will not do the job. so far this year, my area (near detroit) has had much more snow than in the previous 5 or 6 years, and i have been doing just fine in my 325i (rwd) with all-seasons. and that's with my local govt. having a budget problem so that it takes them several days to get around to plowing my subdivision's streets. the traction and stability controls help a lot, but in general i am very pleased with the way this car gets through the snow. not quite as good as my previous a4 quattro of course, but certainly adequate for this area."
2981,"February  7, 2005  5:35PM",kyfdx,"good point..  what some people, who are not from the midwest don't realize.. is the topography changes dramatically, once you get north of i-70 (basically an east-west line that goes through indianapolis and columbus).     south of that line, the topography is very hilly, and even though this area gets less snow, it is much more difficult to navigate slick areas..   north of that line, most of the area is flat as a billiard table.. and, unless the snow is drifting, it really isn't that hard to navigate..    there are lots of exceptions, but i hope this helps explain why people in detroit or chicago might not need snows, but people in cincinnati might require them.   regards,  kyfdx"
2982,"February  7, 2005  6:21PM",shipo,"i grew up (and learned to drive) in oakland county (just north of detroit), and lived in chicago for 13 years after a 5 year stint in socal, and i would have to say that i don't think i would opt for winter tires if my car already had all-season rubber on it if i lived in the mid-west.  the issue gets a little murkier if the car has summer tires, for me, i'd get the snows. i've spent the last dozen years on the east coast, and given the hilly nature of the local topology, winter tires become even more important.  i survived with all-season rubber in the nyc metro area, however, there were a number of days where i needed to be on the roads, and those tires made for a serious white knuckle trip.  the winter tires i'm currently running have made such a dramatic transformation in the drivability of my car that i doubt seriously if i'll ever not opt for winter tires again. best regards, shipo"
2983,"February  7, 2005  7:17PM",laurasdada,"greetings from the land of the newest dynasty, new england!   ultimately, you are correct.  however, as a life-long new englander and skier (vermont primarily, but now that i'm in boston, maine and new hampster too), i've always done just fine with front-wheel drive, all-season tires and a bit of winter driving common sense.  this is one reason i've stuck with fwd and never felt the need for awd.  that's why i'm so disappointed with the bridgestones' performance in the snow, i may need to buy snow tires!  if i knew i was going to need snows, i may have gone rwd.   the tcs/vsa & abs have kept me going in the desired direction, so i'm not going to spring for snows (or better rated in the snow all seasons) yet.  see how i do the rest of this winter."
2984,"February  7, 2005  9:01PM",joeshan,".02 from the big apple. i was actually out in columbus, oh. just after christmas and had no problems with the rs-a's even in water on top of ice (g35x).  back here in nyc, i had no real problems in our recent ""blizzard"". the only time i was wishing for winter tires was when i was trying to park, or leave my parking space. i just turned on snow mode and turned off the vdc. a lot of rocking back and forth was required. i realize that all-season tires are at best a compromise. the awd is best for getting going and helps in turns, but awd doesn't do anything for stopping in the snow. i wish that the infiniti wheels were not so expensive, as i would have a dedicated set of winter tires in the original size. i'd prefer pirelli sotto zero or dunlops, as i feel that they would last longer than blizzaks. too bad nokkia or gislaved don't make winter tires in this size."

2989,"February 21, 2005  4:59AM",hox,thanks for the insight. the g35 is a great car.  the problem i have reading up on the g35 is gas mileage.  it seems to get aroud 15-18 mpg versus 25-28 mpg for the tl. i wonder where the subaru would come in at gas mileage.  i have heard the turbo can get close to 25 mpg on the highway and that's a 250 hp engine.
2990,"February 21, 2005  5:14AM",jrock65,"the real world gas mileage difference between the g and the tl isn't nearly that much.  the tl gets about 22 mpg on average, and the g gets about 20 mpg."

2993,"February 22, 2005 10:43PM",ljwalters1,"i haven't driven the subaru, but i know that of those 3, the acura tl has a much nicer interior.  the g35 has a metal face covering the center controls (radio/a/c/etc) and it looks really tacky, fake and cheap.  my in-laws have one and complain that the metal scratches pretty easily, too.i'd think the tl would be the slowest off-the-line b/c of the low-end torque, but, frankly, it's plenty-fast for me.  with the manual, the clutch engages really early, so that might help (not sure).  overall, they're all fast.  since i don't live near an autobahn-type road, the tl was the clear winner b/c of the luxury features.  tl also got the best crash-test ratings, and i think consumer reports ranks it higher than the others.as an aside, if you are even just considering navigation, go with the acura and get it.  the system is amazing - totally integrated with a/c and radio, so you can do a lot w/o taking your eyes off the road or hands off the wheel.  plus, if you know the phone number of your destination, you can program a route without your hands leaving the wheel.  you can also use it instead of calling ""info"" - type in the store you want and it's name, address and phone # come up so you can call them.  it's fantastic.  one of those things you don't realize how neat it is until you have it."
2994,"February 23, 2005  5:27PM",gordonwd,"this may sound like a weird question, and i am not asking for myself, but is there any car in this classification that does not require premium grade gasoline?"

3037,"March  7, 2005  6:57PM",shipo,"""traction is traction, whether it's off the line, cruising or in a turn...""well, no, not really.  static weight distribution (ie. front/rear weight bias) and driving dynamics play a substantial part in winter driving as well.three examples (assuming two otherwise identical fwd and rwd cars driving in snowy conditions):acceleration: under light acceleration (ie. very little front to rear weight transfer), the fwd car, with its ~60/40 weight distribution will have more traction than the rwd car with its ~50/50 weight distribution.  however, under stronger acceleration, since weight transfers to the rear in such a situation, the front tires will lose traction whereas the rwd car will gain traction.around a curve: the lighter back end of the fwd car will come unglued before the heavier front end of the car under some circumstances, while in others (accelerating through a curve for instance), since the front tires are being asked to do double duty (accelerating and turning), they will break loose (and plow) before the back end.  a rwd car with a good traction control system will be less prone to either of those two scenarios.braking:  the fwd car, which already has a significant front end bias, will load up even more with the weight transfer of braking, allowing the back end to become very light and lose traction, and without the aid of tcs, could very well find said back end leading the front end down the road.  the rwd car, given its better balance will be less susceptible to that situation as well.best regards,shipo"

3127,"April  3, 2005 10:49PM",bpoint,"151ranch,isn't the tl navi system an option with the 6 speed mt?the tl also has a dash light dimmer.  i set mine real low.  it has two settings, one for headlights off, one for headlights on.  there is also a max button that quickly toggles it between the max setting and your setting.  the dealers set it to the max setting for some reason."

3132,"April  5, 2005  4:58PM",squirtdad,subaru legacy gt (sedan or wagon) is another option to look at.  the 2005 is more upscale interior than previous models.    performance is in par or greater than most of wat you have listed.  (250 hp/250 ftlbs forge with turbo 2.5 liter)
3133,"April  5, 2005  5:31PM",blueguydotcom,"wow, couldn't disagree more.  the 2.5 gt limited has you sit up high (like a g35), the interior's very basic and very cheap feeling.  no auto window up/down.  that's right, one window has auto down.  cheapy leather, clunky plastics.  and the engine...ayecarumba.  it pulls strongly but it's load and sounds like it may break at any moment.  gas mileage is horrid.  even on the freeway at cruising speeds in 5th the engine is pulling high rpms.  if one runs 80 mph, you're never gonna break 22-22 mpg on a long trip."
3134,"April  6, 2005  4:52PM",398lbft,"you may as well look at the wrx sti and mitsubishi evo for that price range. if you're looking for more space or less #%) junk in the interior, but want to avoid the tl and cts, theres always the g35, maxima se and altima se-r.for decent gas mileage, go with the small simple japanese cars. sentra se-r spec v and corolla xrs. they are fun, and are more practical than the mini cooper s."

3137,"April 15, 2005 12:42PM",kdshapiro,"well i couldn't disagree more. after making the rounds to many, many dealers including subaru i understand why subaru owners are passionate about their cars. their interiors may not be up to bmw quality. but their drivetrain is every bit as good. the forester xt premium for example, can't hold a candle amenity wise to any car in this thread, but it will go to 60 in 5.25 seconds and it costs $15k less than the 330. the $15k one could save could be invested in another car, the market, your house...etc. so yes, the compromise is in the interior, but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter, engine or drivetrain.while you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30. show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 5.25 seconds, like the forester xt(see review in caranddriver.com ) and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway."
3138,"April 15, 2005  3:33PM",blueguydotcom,"so yes, the compromise is in the interior, but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter, engine or drivetrain.absolutely, 100% disagree.  the engine, shifter and tranny are rough, unrefined, loud and fill me with anything but confidence in the car's abilities.  while you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30. show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 5.25 seconds, like the forester xt(see review in caranddriver.com ) and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway.the scooby xt won't get 30 mpg running 80 mph.  according to edmunds the 2005 xt manual is rated at 23-24 mpg for the freeway.  the engine runs to high in the rpm to approach that feat.  and at 90 mph, i know it won't come even close to 24.  turbo 4s are fun but not economical when matched to lousy gearing.scoobies are fun but they're not on the level of entry lux cars by any stretch."
3139,"April 15, 2005  3:50PM",designman,"that the legacy gt and forester xt have sloppy suspensions especially the latter which also has incredibly slow and numb steering. even the outback configuration trumps them handily imo, ironic since they raised the ride height. the driver&#146;s subies are the wrxs. outback xt is the best compromise if you need utility."
3140,"April 15, 2005  4:04PM",kdshapiro,"actually i couldn't disagree more. the shifter is snappy and crisp, the suspension is taut, and the car takes off like greased lightning. faster than any other car in this thread. it holds the road on par with the fx35/x3. i agree it does not have the amenities and the vehicle does have a numb spot in the steering. but it begs for more, and you can give it more and it inspires the same confidence as the 3er. and it cost $10k++ less than the other vehicles in this board.i agree, you give up some. the interior of the scooby isn't up to the interior quality of these vehicles. but you pay less, get less amenities but more drive.as for the gas mileage, in this part of the country you don't fly around at 80, unless you want a big fat ticket so i'm not worried. but people i know who have the car get 27+ doing around 65 and that's just fine with me. and did i mention it cost less than the other vehicles in this segment.i'm not promoting the vehicle nor do i really believe it belongs in this thread, imho, it has the guts to compete with these other fine cars at a different level. maybe less luxury and amenities, but it will blow the doors off of them. to some people that's important, to others it's not. there is no right or wrong. ymmv."

3142,"April 15, 2005 10:39PM",lmacmil,"remember the econ 101 concept of marginal utility?  that's where the entry level luxury sedans come up short in my opinion.  let's face it, most of us do most of our driving in rather routine commuting.  those of us in the midwest don't have many exciting roads to drive, unlike much of the west and east coast.  i started my search looking at tls, tsxes, and g35s.  then the scottish hertitage kicked in and i asked myself why should i pay $30k+ for my 8 mile city commute.  i just couldn't rationalize it.  i ended up with a camry se-v6.  not as luxurious as the the tl or es330 (although same powertrain as the latter), not as fast as the g35, not sporty as the bmw but for me, the marginal utility of that extra $7-10,000 just wasn't there.  it's luxurious and fast enough for me though obviously for many of you, it isn't."

3144,"April 16, 2005  7:01PM",buddhabman,designman -  in terms of handling the only car that can be considered to be more poised is the bmw 330i.   driving the old gen legacy on twisty mountain roads was pure fun. the new legacy gt with power can hold it's own with any of the cars in this segment. it's known for having one of the most stable driving feel on bumpy roads.
3145,"April 18, 2005  2:42PM",designman,"bumpy roads and sport suspensions are like oil and water, so if a legacy gt is good in that environment it is testament to its soft suspension&#151;ability to absorb shock. i will agree to disagree with you on this and i find that the reviews overrated it considerably."

3150,"April 18, 2005  5:32PM",designman,"doesn&#146;t matter where you drive, the legacy gt handles like a boat whether it&#146;s the atlantic or indian ocean. outback has a much tighter suspension. forget about the forester, it's not even on the map in the handling category. leads me to believe that, like the legacy, you haven't driven it."
3151,"April 18, 2005  8:28PM",kdshapiro,"hmm. you may be right about the legacy, i don't think i drove it, i drove the outback, my impression was it was more trucky like. (i've driven so many they all blend in). but, surely the forester xt will not outhandle a sedan. but for what it is, silky smooth shifter, power galore with the turbo, taut suspension, spacious cross-over, 5.3 to 60, lsd and $$$ less than an x3, it's a perfect vehicle for some. heck, it'll blow past an fx45. can you tell i had a blast driving it? the cabin noise from the windup of the turbo is right on the money. although it clearly does not belong in the entry level segment, as the amenities are not up to others in the segment, it's a lot of bang for the buck.and finally for those who dwell on such things, it's reliable and it got the iihs best pick. comparing it against a 330, no it's not all that, but you know what it's $15k less. and subaru scrimped in the amenities, not the engine, handling or drivetrain."
3152,"April 20, 2005  5:37AM",jcj1,"i need to make a purchasing decision in the next few days. i have narrowed the field down to two: an infiniti g35 rwd sedan or a subaru legacy gt ltd wagon. i can get either car for $500 over invoice via the costco program, and the two cars are within a couple of hundred dollars of each other with the options i want. for the g35, i opt for rwd because i live in the california where there is no real need for awd. i'd go with the at because i feel the g35 accelarate more smoothly with the at, while the 6mt is a bit notchy and also less practical for my daily commute. for the subaru, i opt for the wagon because i love the oversize sunroof and the wagon is a bit roomier and also looks a bit nice (my personal opinion). unfortunately the at does not work well with the 2.5 turbo in the subaru, and the 5mt with sti short throw shifter and momo shift knob is so much fun to drive that it reminds me of a mazda miata. so i think i'd go with the mt for the subaru.now the questions:1) my wife is a bit concerned about the durability of turbo engine as we plan to keep our car for a long time (we kept our last two cars for 10-15 years). is this a good enough reason to stay away from the subaru?2) how is the predicted reliability of subaru compared to infiniti? this is our no. 1 priority. so far we only have experience with honda and toyota which have been pretty much trouble free. can i expect the same level of quality and reliability from subaru or infiniti/nissan?3) is $500 over invoice a good price for these cars? is it worth bargaining for a price that is significantly better than costco's?your help is most appreciated. thanks!"
3153,"April 20, 2005 12:52PM",kdshapiro,"some thoughts:1. cars with turbos in the long run are probably less problem free than cars without. in 15 years, who can tell what the reliability of a turbo car is? but in 15 years, what will be the reliability of the g35?2. you can get a lot of reliability information from the annual car buyers issue of consumer reports. you can read the subaru and infiniti forums for some insight as to the types of issues people are experiencing.3. i would starting negotiating under invoice and work my way up, rather than to work my way down.good luck"

3155,"April 20, 2005  2:30PM",shipo,"back in the 1980s when chrysler was the largest producer of turbocharged engines in the world, i had not one but two of their cars.  both were running strong at 100,000 miles when i traded them in, and i had no doubt that they would have continued to provide me with excellent service had i decided to keep them.  having said that, within my immediate sphere of family and friends, there were five other mopar turbos that i was aware of, and each one of them required a turbo replacement within the first 75,000 miles (one needed two turbo replacements).  the only difference that i could figure was that while we all followed the standard maintenance plan, i used mobil-1 while the rest of them used whatever oil their dealership happened to use.i switched to mobil-1 from castrol-gtx when i got my first turbo simply because i'd heard of bearing issues due to the oil being coked when the oil supply was abruptly cut off from the hot/high speed turbine bearings at engine shutdown.  i reasoned that the synthetic oil would be much more capable of resisting coking, and while my sampling of two isn't definitive, it was enough to cause me to use nothing but mobil-1 in every car i've had since then.best regards,shipo"

3160,"April 25, 2005  2:09AM",kdshapiro,i understand and am not debating that point. i was only pointing out that after a test drive or two i understand why there is almost a cult like following for the cars. they are not entry level luxos. but the drivetrain is beyond reproach and the shifter is silky smooth.the forester for example was clocked at 5.3 to 60 by c&d with only 210 hp. like the bimmers these cars are sleepers. but again i realize the luxury factor is not up to their bigger cousins.
3161,"April 25, 2005  1:28PM",gordonwd,"that's the ""problem"" with getting into the luxury segment: you get spoiled by all the features that you did quite well without when you didn't know about them   . two cars ago i owned a sentra se-r that i thought was a really great car -- sort of the early 90's equivalent to the wrx in being a pocket-rocket, sleeper type of compact car. when i got my a4, i suddenly woke up to all the features that i didn't have in the sentra: power windows, climate control, great stereo, and on and on. now i don't think i can go back to what now seems like a stripped-down car like the sentra, and in retrospect even my a4 seems like it was lacking compared to my 325i (how did i ever get along without memory power seats??   ). and i just read a road test the other day of a car in this segment, and the reviewer knocked it down because it had heated seats but no heated steering wheel, if you can believe that!"

3187,"May 26, 2005  5:07PM",djocks,"i am coming off the lease of a 03 330i and i have been shopping a great deal in the recent months.  i like many on this board am in need of a family friendly sedan (4 doors) that will serve primarily as a commuter for me.  i drive about 50 miles a day.i thought for a while that i would like the g35(6mt), but after driving one for almost a day i was not a fan with the way the car set up.  the interior had maxima written all over it (to be honest, it is the interior they should've put in the maxima).  the performance was strong and obviously fast but it did not possess the crisp feeling of my 330i.  so the g35 became an after thought.  (i will speak more on it later)so now it is going to come down to the tl v bmw.  i had the honor of taking out the new 06 325i (6-mt) yesterday and a tip of the hat to everyone waiting for one.  i know what the horsepower says, and i can read the 0-60 times but i say without hesitation that the new 325i absolutely rips the g35 and tl apart.  it feels as fast as my present 330i and the driving experience is actually improved.  it is truly another typical bmw ""how do they do that?"" experiences.  and after driving the 3 cars, anyone who says the g35 or tl is close to the 325i is saying that because that is what they have in their garage.  i am coming at you honestly b/c i am leaning towards the tl, but the fun factor of driving the 325i is not even measurable.  it truly is a 4-door sports car.  the sales person asked if i wanted to take the 330i out and i said no.  reason being is, if i do, i know i will regret not getting one every day i drive something else.  the other big positive, is the new stereo is ""about time"".  the hk's in bmw's are flat out garbage and have no business being in such a car.  the new logic 7 sounded awesome for the little time i used it.however,the feeling from the drivers seat is tight.  both in a good way, and a bad way.  it is a fully connected driving experience but it still feels small.  a cruising machine this is not.  now the real bad.  there is no noticeable difference in back seat room.  i am 6' tall and i would want no part of sitting behind me.  also a very big flaw, it getting in the passenger seat.  i must have looked funny as i got in and out several times, and each time i hit my left knee on the dash which is now bowed out rather than in.  i can hear my wife now saying how much she ""hates getting in and out of that thing!"".  i like the look, but i just feel from the outside the tl looks more aggressive.  something about the lower rockers that make it look more aggressive.  i like the front and the back does not bother me but i bet that when the m3 hits we all say, wow thats they way they all should look.  much like the 5 series and m5.  that brings me to the tl and away from the g35.  since i feel (and you will too if you ever drive the new bimmers) that there is nothing like them, it does not make a difference what else you get, it is not the best.  so other factors then come into play.  the total size and interior of the tl i find gorgeous, not to mention they have every toy in the book.  the germans make engines and the japanese make technology.  the nav system and stereos on the tl are as you know, simply the best around.  the seats are big and comfortable.  and the back seat is perfect for a father of one who is getting bigger every day.  i live in the northeast and front wheel drive also has advantages.  simply put the tl is a fast, and very nice touring sedan that is perfect for a commute.  i still need to give things a little thought.  i really would love the bmw but i think the tl is a better fit for my life in 2005.  i am going to be very jealous though every time i see a 330i screeming around some turn and the driver smiling from ear to ear.  i hope you liked my take.....djocks"

3196,"May 27, 2005  7:10PM",aaargh,"when it comes right down to it, the choice between the tl, bmw, and g35 is about what is important to you.  if performance is what is most important to you, the bmw or g35 is the way to go.  they both excel (excuse the pun) in the performance department. but, imho, they are a little shy in the size, comfort, and luxury area.if you are looking for a mix of good (albeit not top notch) performance with luxury, the tl is hard to beat, especially at several thousand less than the comparably equipped bmw and g35.i test-drove all 3 (&#145;05 bmw, not &#146;06).  i bought and am very happy with my tl."

3254,"May 31, 2005  9:45PM",ljwalters1,"i agree with you regarding the tl feeling roomier than the g.  i bet the measurements are similar, but some aspect just makes the g feel more closed-in to me.  maybe it's as simple as the fact that the g35 i drove had a black interior - that could've made it seem smaller.regardless i'm happy with the tl, and not sure what other storage space you would want, aaargh.  we've got side door sill pockets that expand; a bi-level center console that's so deep they added a light to it; rear seatbacks; a little flip-out drawer in the back of the center console; closable/concealable cupholders; 2 drawers in the center-stack (maybe more if you don't have nav); and a decent-sized glove box.  only thing i can figure is you want a sunglass-holder in the roof or a drawer under the dash on the left side.  overall, i think there's a lot of storage space."

(although, with the advent of acura, lexus and infiniti, european prices have come down.  more supply/competition in the near/luxury market).  however, as there is enough demand for bmw products, well, that's the price you pay, doc.  you want bmw prices to come down to g35 levels?  you'd better start convincing the kds and blueguys of the world not to keep buying bimmers.obviously, a bmw is overpriced to you.  you are correct.  to kd & blueguy, a bmw is a good value.  they are correct.  i believe my tl to be a great car and value, i'm correct.    i'm sure cts owners feel their car is fabulous.  they are incorrect...  drive 'em all, buy one and enjoy!"

3413,"June 17, 2005  3:24AM",shipo,"your comments echo my own feelings of seven years ago.  back then i was a happy 1995 vr6 passat glx 5-speed driver and was looking forward to getting a 1999 passat with the same basic features as my 1995 plus a couple of extra goodies like power memory seats, climate control and automatic wipers.  as fortune would have it, the 1998 passat glx was equipped exactly as i wanted my next car to be equipped, then came the 1999 model year.  bzzzt!  i'm sorry, that is incorrect!  why?  vw in their infinite wisdom discontinued the 5-speed manual for that model year, and that model year only.  why?  beats the willies out of me.as i refused to yield on my combination of a manual transmission and at the very least the power seats (i was valet parking two to three times a week at that time and yikes can a parking valet screw up a perfectly positioned manual seat), and climate control (i hate fiddling with the controls every time the sun goes behind a cloud in the summer time).  so, with the above in mind, that left the following cars:- infiniti i30/nissan maxima twins (ugly and mushy suspensions compared to my passat)- audi a4 (too small in the back seat area -- two kids in car seats you know)- saab 9-3 (local dealer refused to order me one with a 5-speed)- volvo s70 (same dealer as the saab, and the same attitude regarding the 5-speed)- bmw 528i (too slow, couldn't afford the 540i, and ewwww, that bmw stigma)- bmw 328i (a little smaller inside than the 1999 passat but otherwise just about perfect excepting of course for that same bmw stigma)with all of that said, once i drove the 328i, i was hooked.  nuthin' and i do mean nuthin' even came close, so, stigma be damned.  i've been driving bmws ever since.best regards,shipo"

3425,"June 17, 2005  4:28PM",shipo,"the ""stigma"" that i was referring to, and what i objected to, is sort of two separate parts:1) the poseurs who buy a bmw to make a statement but have no idea/inclination on how to actually drive the damn thing2) the ""slash & burn"" drivers, which in days gone by were often exemplified by someone in a bmw slicing his or her way down a crowded roadway, cutting off folks with blatant disregard for anybody but themselves.from my perspective, you cannot do anything about stigma #1, it is what it is and now with the advent of the japanese luxury brands, the bmw poseur thing has been reasonably diluted.  as for the stigma #2 folks, that too seems to have been a bit diluted in recent years with the advent of slammed hondas, neons and gallants that many gear heads seem to be fond of.at this point, now seven years after i initially went through the process of convincing myself to even consider driving a bmw, i don't even give it a second thought.  i have really liked my two bmws, and it is surely going to take one hell of an amazing car from some other marque for me seriously look elsewhere.best regards,shipo"

3453,"June 18, 2005 11:23PM",laurasdada,"hello, odessit:my prefrences are for a luxury/sport sedan (tl) as opposed to sport/luxury (325).  also, as a lifelong skier and denizen of the mountains of vermont, new hampster and maine i prefer front wheel drive.  i'll give up the 9 or 10/10ths handling advantages of rwd for the traction (and packaging) of fwd.  the tl handles very well for my tastes.  having said that, the tires on the base tl are terrible in the snow!  that'll teach me.  i considered a 325x/330x but i decided i didn't need the added weight and complexity of awd.  i've gotten along just fine without awd lo these many years in the snow/mountains.  not to mention my new england frugality just wouldn't let me spend so much more for the bmw, especially since i knew the '06 were on the way.  similarly equipped, the tl is less money.  had i really wanted the 3, i would have bought it and i'm sure loved it.  but, for me, the tl was a bertter car and value.  i also shopped the g35 and mercedes e320 ( a different animal, i know, but it is such an appealing car to me.  again, i just didn't see the value proposition).of course now with 20/20 hindsight and a n.e. winter behind me, a rwd 3 with decent all-seasons would probably have better traction than my tl with the bridgestones (they're supposedly all-seasons as long as none of the seasons include snow) in the snow!  the best laid plans...anyway, had i gone with any of the other ellps i'm sure i would have been just as happy as i am with the tl.  a wonderful class of cars, tough decision.  you really can't go wrong.oh, yeah.  frisconick:  will you adopt me and buy me an aston martin, daddy?"

3470,"June 21, 2005  4:19AM",draknad,"it's almost amazing.  it seems recent posts support what i tried to post earlier.  (eg. #3608, why people buy bmw)finally there's no hesitation to question a bmw's value.  it almost seemed people are afraid to question bmw's, since it's been foolishly jamed into minds...bmw's are ""high performance, high quality..."".  mostly by magazines(press), friends(who like the label), and the high price to own.but as these posts say, it's mostly opinion, and actually, bmw's probably aren't worth the high price for similar performance.one thing i still don't see many people admitting, is bmw, benzes, and audi's low reliability and high cost of maintanance.  i feel this is in the direction of pride.  no one likes to admit cost paid, vs more cost spent to maintain.and it is fact, bmw's do break down more then average, consumeraffairs.com/news03/jdpower.html little old (2003)benz clsdiff class2002and it does cost more once it's in shop (vs asian, us brands).  of course it depends who drives, but when the car is in the shop, pull out the wallet."
3471,"June 21, 2005  5:10AM",shipo,"one of the biggest problems that i have with folks who like to take issue with owning a bmw is that they like to dwell on the negative by slamming bmw because they are &#147;unreliable and expensive to maintain&#148;.  that line of bilge has been repeated so often that to some at least, it has become fact.  sorry, but i have never seen any evidence, scientific, anecdotal or otherwise to support such a claim.  the simple truth is that cars, all cars, are far more reliable now then they have been at anytime in history, and bmws are some of the most reliable.ahhh, buy the naysayers will say, ""oh yeah!  well just look at the statistics referenced in the above post.  you'll see that toyota has 196/pp100 vs. bmws 262/pp100 rating.""uh-huh, well personally both numbers look pretty damn good to me, and furthermore, comparing the full north american bmw line (all fairly complex performance/luxury cars) to the full line of toyotas (starting with no/low option strppo econo-boxes with far fewer components to fail) seems to be a bit disingenuous if you ask me.  to my way of thinking at least, a much more fair comparison would be lexus vs. bmw, and while i haven't seen those numbers in a while, if memory serves, the gap was much narrower.  even still, the report shows that for every four problems reported by a toyota owner, a bmw owner will report roughly five.  so much for being &#147;unreliable&#148;.  i did find it interesting to note that bmw and a few other european manufacturers were singled out in the following quote: &#147;porsche, jaguar, saab and bmw perform well above the industry average in dependability&#148; as being quite reliable.another knock that i continually read about bmws is that they cost a lot of money to maintain.  that too is pure fabrication.  the only out of pocket expense a late model bmw owner should experience for the first 50,000 miles is tires.  period, full stop, the end.  everything else is covered under the full maintenance program.  once a car has enough miles and/or years to no longer be covered under the maintenance program, they seem pretty reasonable to maintain, especially given their very long service intervals called for in the owner's manual.  basically, change the oil every year or 15,000 miles, change the brake fluid every two years and the coolant every three or four years (iirc).  as for the scheduled ""services"", those occur every 30,000 miles, and while the cost can range from $600 to over $1,000, when you consider the number of miles that cost gets amortized over, it just ain't that much money.said another way, my bet is that if you were to do an ""apples to apples"" comparison of a new e90 3-series vs. a new second generation lexus is, my bet is that the bmw will cost less money for general maintenance and repair than the lexus for at least the first 100,000 miles.  how much less?  probably not too much, but less is still less.me personally, i'm waiting to drive the is and the e90 back to back, and i'll go with the one i like the best.  their relative reliability and the cost of maintenance is, in my mind at least, not a defining issue.best regards,shipo"
3472,"June 21, 2005 11:03AM",geekay,"when you fork out 1000's more, one thing you would expect is more reliability. the is is the best of the lot in that respect. every one has their own story to tell, i have not really seen bmw being run down here, in fact it is the other way around, there is wholesale plagiarizing of hyperbole to describe the bmws as compared to the competition. it is as if use of flowery language and the name is enough to make their cup run over. reminds of an old chestnut: guy buys a bmw and drives it otd, car stops 2 miles later. owner calls dealer, car is inspected, there is no engine. owner asks, how did it drive 2 miles? oh, that would be the reputation, says the dealer, usually gets it so far. have a nice day folks."

3623,"July 19, 2005  1:04PM",ljwalters1,"i'll have to weigh in on the side of the tl - here's some general comments (no particular order), and i include a little scoring system (+1 for 1st, 0 for 2nd, -1 for 3rd) that's really just for my own fun.:1.  ride quality.  as far as ride quality, i'd guess you prefer a cushier, luxurious ride to a sporty, tight ride.  the used gs430 your considering would probably have the best ride, but with all the high-tech features you want, the tl would probably be a good compromise between comfort, price and features.  the g35 has the most sporty, probably least forgiving ride of the 3. (gs 1; tl  0; g35 -1)2.  status.  i think acura has the least status among lexus, infiniti and acura.  i think lexus is #1 of those 3, so the gs has it here, too.   (gs 2; tl -1; g35 -1)3.  features.  the used gs isn't going to be the most technologically advanced.  of the 3 cars you might be considering, the tl has it hands down, with all the features you mentioned except for traffic navigation (only in the rl & maybe the infiniti m) and a video player.  you'll also have to say goodbye to rain-sensing wipers (something i sorely miss from my last car).  the voice-recognition of the tl's nav and its integration with climate control and the radio is utterly amazing!!!  i cannot understate this (you can be driving and just verbally tell the car to change the temp, pass temp only, direct air through particular vents, etc.  you can scroll through your presets, and when there's nothing on the radio, direct the cd player to play any particular track on any particular disc - it's awesome!!!!).  as an aside, the infiniti m, which is out of your price range and might be too rough a ride, has the best technological features of any car i know.  if it came with a manual transmission, it'd be my dream car.  another bonus to the tls nav is that it's a touch-screen, which makes entering info manually much easier than otherwise, and you can enter info while in motion.  my parents lexus does not allow this.  i don't know about the g35s nav, but, in general, i think the g35 is the least technically advanced of the 3, but a new g would have it over an onlder lexus, i think. (gs 1; tl 0; g35 -1)price.  i'm not checking the classifieds for you, but i know that to get all the tech features you want, it'll add much more to the gs, since it'll probably need to be aftermarket, if it can be done at all, and it'll cost the least extra on the tl b/c it's all included, except the nav, which is pretty common.  depending on the changes made on the '06 models, you might be willing to save even more $$$ by buying a used tl or g35. (gs 0; tl 1; g35 -1)anyway, my scoring has the tl ontop (no surprise - it's what i drive), but disregarding the scoring for a sec, you need to discount the bmw & g35 b/c they value sportiness over luxury, and you seem to prefer luxury.  the gs has it in luxurious ride and prestige; the tl has it in technology.  i think your choice comes down to those two, and will depend on which you value more.ps - i think a guy will be more impressed by a tl than a gs.  as a single gal, that might play into things a bit."

3639,"July 22, 2005  2:58AM",delmar1,"still think i am misleading?  my apologies...but let me mention a few items to clearify that my intent was not to mislead.first...most likely than not...when people think of g35..they think of the coupe and the sedan is a secondary thought.  therefore...i priced the coupe.  i hope i supported my pricing of $37,000 for the g35 coupe 6mt in my previous note.  i think all will agree to the prices paid as demonstrated on the board postings on this web site.  the $37k is fact.as for the price of the g35 sedan...i did not specifically get a pricing.  however i understand that it is roughly about $35.5k.  i believe compared to the tl w/nav of $32.2k which was demonstrated by 'laydi' email quote from the dealer.second paragraph.  yes...i did not bargain further on the g35 as i disclosed in my initial note.  however...once again...the pricing i provided is pricing paid by others on the board...after negotiations.  please refer to the messages on the board which i referred to...those are actual paid prices ($37k for a g35 6mt coupe).  i did not make them up.  $37k...fact once again.so let me summarize.  most think of the g35 as a coupe.  the g35 6mt coupe with nav is selling for $37k according to multiple postings on this web site's board.  the g35 sedan is approximately $35.5k.  these prices compares to acura tl which is being initially quoted to a prospective buyer at $32.5k...with a likely purchase price of ~$32k after negotiations.  all in all...forget the discussion of the pricing.  look towards my initial email today which goes over the various amentities of the tl...and how it addresses 'laydi' initial email which communicates her wants and desires in a car....she wants the world.  the tl should be considered."

'the tl is clearly a better overall vehicle than the g35 sedan'.  but that is up for discussion.... what topic of comparison of the tl and gs sedan do we wish to discuss?"

(why people talk about performance and then say the racetrack does not matter is beyond me?)if you want features go with the tl, other the g35 is a fine choice."

3657,"July 22, 2005  7:37PM",delmar1,i am agreeable to the gs as tilted more towards the luxury end.  i would say it is more comparable to the acura rl.  of course...you need to consider the gs 430 and not the gs 300 to get more sport elements.

3661,"July 22, 2005  8:06PM",jamesspot,"for performance package, natural brown leather, xenons, and cold weather package (fold down rear seats, heated front seats, and headlight washers ). the car was only $10k more than a v-6 accord and less than $5k more than either the tl or the g35. to me - worth it. still, the smaller engined 325i outsold the 330i by 6 to 1, so price does make a difference, even for the average bmw consumer.i really like the tl - a very nice car - good-looking, fast, comfortable, a beautiful interior, and all the high tech done right.i also like the g35, particularly with a manual transmission. it has ""v-8 like"" power and good brakes. the automatic transmission is the weakest link in the g35 sedan.i think the gs300 and 430 are in another class all together and compete against the 5 series bmw and the acura rl. the lexus equivalent is the updated is250 and 350. i'm still waiting to check those two out. the old is handled fine, but was a bit gaudy for my taste.i still think the tl is the one for the lady, as it nicely bridges the gap between her soft, luxurious es300 and the  g35. a little more sport than what she drove before, but not the whole hog of the g35."
3662,"July 22, 2005 10:06PM",nyrefugee,"""the g ""base"" sedan has no amentities and is not comparable. need to upgrade with the premium package and sports suspension package.""ok i really do not like flame wars, but since some people may actually use these forums to make a car buying decision i feel like i should disagree with this statement. the g base actually has a lot of features. power leather heated seats six cd in dash changer with mp3, adjutsable wheel with telescoping, adjustable rear seats, power window and mirrors, side and curtain airbags, xenon lights etc. not as much features as the accord of course but enough that you are not really missing anything. and as such it is 2k cheaper than the base acord. if you insist that the premium package is necessary for comparison then the g35 is about 1.5 k more expensive. and no the g35 does not need the performance package to compare with a base accord. the g35 multilink suspension is more advanced than the acura double wishbone one. also the g35 uses aluminum in its suspension elements i am not sure if the acura does (they dont mention it, which probably means they use steel). in any event the g35 will handle better even if you do not consider the acura's fwd. and the problems with the fwd have already been beaten to death in these forums. so in conclusion a standard suspension g35 will handle better than the standard tl suspension. on top of everything else if you get the manual tranny you get the performance package standard as well. so then you have to add the 18 inch wheels to the tl in order to make it comparable. so the g35 with the premium package will be about the same price as a comparable tl with the 18 inch wheels. i cannot give exact numbers here because the 18 inch wheels on the tl require unspecified dealership installation charges. so in summary:g35 auto vs tl auto = tl is 1.5 k cheaperg35 manual vs tl manual = about the same pricein these packages the tl has some more features and better interior while the g35 has more powerful engine and better handling. there you go."
3663,"July 22, 2005 10:33PM",delmar1,i am getting out of this discussion.   but since people may be making educated buying decisions...let me list a few things included in the 'premium package' ... many features which are already included in the tl pricing...but which require additional costs to upgrade from a base g35:sunroof. premium audio system with 7 speakers.driver's seat memory with entry/exit assist. steering wheel memory. electrochromic auto-dimming inside mirror. homelink universal transceiver. etc.and...don't forget to include the xm satellite radio.i am out and done with this discussion.  both cars are fine.  test drive both...and make an educated decision.

3772,"August  4, 2005  9:55PM",taxesquire,"i love my tl, and i never regret switching from a passat to a tl.  that being said, let me be nitpicky.  1stly, i had a passat glx 5mt.  meaning it was a 6 cyl engine with all the amenities standard.  i now have a 6mt tl w/ nav.i believe the passat is gonna have about 250 hp, so it's #s will be comparable to the tl, and it might even have more low-end torque, it could be faster 0-30.  no way the passat will handle as well as the tl, though, making the tl a lot more fun to drive.  both interiors are well done - the tl seems a notch above, even though the passat had real wood and the tls is fake.  if you're going manual transmission, the tls is by far more enjoyable.  i love the early clutch engagement and it shifts very smoothely.as far as luxury features that i use, it's pretty close.  the tls nav makes it much, much better than the passat, imo.  but if you're comparing non-nav vehicles, other than a 6-disc changer, i'm not sure what luxury features the tl has that the passat doesn't.  one is that the tls lights shut-off automatically.  also, i like that the tl doesn't have a loud ""ding"" to let you know you're low on fuel.  i'd often find myself driving where the tank is just at the cutoff level and the light would go on and off, dinging each time.  i also like the tls auto-a/c better.  for some reason, the passat's would always be 1 level too strong for me.  the 1 thing that drove me crazy about the passat was the steering wheel radio controls.  the buttons should be on the left and the station changer should scroll the presets - vw got it backwards.here are some things i miss from the passat:  the key integrated fob (tl uses a separate fob and regular key); electric fold-in mirrors; rear sunshade; rain-sensing wipers.  also, the passat had nicer computer controls b/c (1) there were 2 sets of settings (tl has 1); (2) you didn't need to take your hand off the wheel to scroll through the options; (3) the passat gave you more info on each screen; (4) the tl makes you hit a ""display"" button to display mpg, ave mph, etc.as far as differences that aren't good or bad, the passat's seats are more firm, the tl's are softer.frankly, from what i'v heard of the '06 passat, it might be a tough deciding between the 2, but i'd expect the tl to give you a better value b/c passats will probably go for msrp initially.to sum up, if you have a top-of-the-line passat and enjoy it, but want something a tad more luxurious and a lot more sporty, you'll love the tl.  if you're all about comfort and convenience, but won't get the nav, it might be close, and there will be some things you miss about the passat.hope this helps!!! sorry it's so long."

3856,"August 18, 2005  3:49PM",taxesquire,"now that most autos in this category are 5 and 6 speed automatics, it wouldn't surprise me if pedal-to-the-metal on a straightaway, they were faster than their manual cousins due to human limitations, though tests don't seem to show that as being the case.  i feel confident that a 5 speed automatic would be clearly faster than a manual of the same car driven by myself. :blush:   but taking out the human error is what makes the car less sporty.it's not so much whether you can lay out the dough to buy a fast car - it's whether you personally can make any particular car operate at its best, regardless of whether that means keeping rpms down to stretch every last ounce of gas or running right up to the redline.  i'd think i'd get more satisfaction out of maximizing the hp in a manual 4 cylinder honda accord than just slamming my foot down on an automatic porsche boxter.think about nascar - the argument that it's not a sport is based on the fact that it mainly involves machines, and the best machine will win.  pro-nascar arguments revolve around the human interaction - when to slow down, when to accelerate, when to block an opposing car, the pit crew, etc.  automatics take a level of involvement out of the equation and lessen the ""sport"" of the whole thing."
3857,"August 18, 2005  3:52PM",brightness04,"not sure why you are addressing that to me.  are you saying a person merging onto an expressway from a red light will be able to shift faster than he/she otherwose would be able to do?  i don't get it.  the discussion was never about manual vs. automatic, but whether the published automatic rating or mnual rating for 0-60 is more relevent to what most owners actually get.  almost no one can  shift a manual as fast as smg (dah, that's why they invented smg in racing); few can shift manual faster than a modern automatic for that matter.  therefore what people actually get from their car are closer to the car's automatic 0-60 rating, not the manual rating when driven by professional drivers.  whether manual or automatic is better for personal taste is entirely a different story altogether, depending on your driving condition etc.."

3861,"August 18, 2005  7:29PM",gordonwd,"i read an interesting explanation the other day about why mag testers such as c&d can usually get better 0-60 times that the manufacturer's rating. it has to do with exactly how the measurement is taken. apparently, most of the magazines use a technique that was developed by the nhra (the drag racing sanctioning body), where they start the timer when the car has moved one foot -- not at the exact instant of when it starts to move. now you might ask how big a deal one foot is, but you would be surprised how long that takes -- it is of course the slowest one foot of the entire run, especially considering what it takes to overcome the inertia of geting the car to start moving.as another example, i used to drive a front-engine dragster that would run the 1/4-mile in about 7.5 seconds. one time, though, i popped the front wheels so that they went over the starting beams and i started the timers with my rear wheels instead of the front wheels. so i basically got a 170"" head start on the clock. my elapsed time on that run was 6.8 seconds, which would have been good for a world record if it had been a legitimate time!"
3862,"August 18, 2005  7:33PM",ivorypearlg,also about the 0-60 times 5.6 seconds for what the 6-spd manual 330i ? well in the new comparo in the automobile mag says that the new 2006 bmw 330i 6-spd does 0-60 in 6.1sec... that is slower then the infiniti g35 6-spd going 0-60 in 5.8 sec. then the last one was with the 6-spd caddy cts moving 0-60 in 6.5 sec.
3863,"August 18, 2005  7:53PM",kdshapiro,"you know what, you can cite all the comparos in the world, it doesn't change the basic fact the infiniti with a bigger engine, more hp and torque cannot really outgun the 330i. so you can cite this comparo, i'll cite the other comparo."
3864,"August 18, 2005  7:54PM",kdshapiro,really? you think? you should see them race. unfortunately i have. accord loses. mine is faster than both of them anyway.
3865,"August 18, 2005  7:58PM",kdshapiro,"some mags pop the clutch or use torque braking.while the numbers the mags get usually are representative of the best times you could achieve, you will rarely hit those numbers unless you wish to damage your drivetrain.i think though it's important that each mag sticks with their established method, so one can compare times.however, i would never do a full torque brake launch with my auto tranny."

3897,"August 18, 2005  9:08PM",ivorypearlg,"thank saab for that turbo ! well i have a feeling infiniti will sneak attack with a bad [non-permissible content removed] sedan version of the gt-r coupe. did i hear a twin-turbo v6 with 450hp, in the air ? you can also expect an early redesign of the g esp with all these new releases in the class coming out ."
3898,"August 18, 2005  9:09PM",ivorypearlg,what will this turbo six be putting out you think ? i think no more then 335hp

3902,"August 18, 2005 10:04PM",bmwe90,"the class is defined by much more than 0-60 times. i'm not entirely convinced bmw has sweaty palms worrying about some car companies that japan cooked up in the late 80's and early 90's. and let's say one bmw exec does - i would guess he's probably head of the m department. i think the fact that lexus has only one vehicle which we can really consider ""performance oriented"" while bmw has not only numerous performance oriented vehicles (any of the larger output engines on all series) but several ""super high performance"" vehicles (m3, m5, & m6) indicates that lexus is trying its best to get a foot in the proverbial door. thats about all lexus has managed to get in so far."
3903,"August 18, 2005 10:07PM",blueguydotcom,did you bother to take a look at the new lexus is350 on the internet. it will be out this fall. also did you look at the g or the saab ? look at everything before you make a decision the is350 has a much smaller back seat than a 3 series.the g35 is best if he wants room.saab...uh why is a saab mentioned in the same breath as rwd cars?
3904,"August 18, 2005 10:15PM",taxesquire,"if it's sporty, it belongs in this thread.  you're not discounting all automatics, as opposed to manual transmission vehicles, are you?"
3905,"August 18, 2005 10:20PM",blueguydotcom,"i purchased an infiniti g35 soon after they were released. it was in the shop for 69 days within the first 8 months of ownership. nissan was horrible to deal with in any respect....if you can live with the fact that you paid almost as much for a car that is manufactured by a company who's claim to fame is the sentra - and you dont mind cost cutting measures literally surrounding you - choose the g. in defense of the g, it is probably the car that comes the closest to the bimmer as far as handling, but it has a long, long way to go before many people would choose it over a 3 series.i can say the same about my 330i.  4 months and bmw's current ""solution"" for the common 3.0 4k engine hesitation is rather draconian: they disable the second set of valves so the engine loses top end power.  but it no longer hesitates, they said to me with a straight face.  great, i've been to bmw 4 times in 4 months and this is their solution for a known problem with the 3.0 engine?every company builds some problem cars...."
3906,"August 18, 2005 10:21PM",ivorypearlg,i am sorry i should have not say the company as a whole. but i am pretty sure that the is350 will be a good contender against the 330i and the g35. yes bmw was around a lot longer then any of the japanese auto makers but it doesn't make them any better ! is mercedes - benz better because they were the first auto manufactor ? i believe that bmw has more then sweaty palms. figure infiniti     gt-r is going to take the m6 and then a high performance version of the m45 with the same tt-450hp v8 will take the m5. the infiniti flagship is holding them back. then all they need is a couple of convert's and you got yourself a full line up ready to go head to head with bmw. give it to 2008.

3908,"August 18, 2005 10:25PM",ivorypearlg,did he say he needed rwd maybe he lives in snowy climates the saab will plow thru the snow while the rwd is350 and the 3's rwd and the rwd infin will be stuck in the garage. look at the acura tl too..  awd g is great also.
3909,"August 18, 2005 10:27PM",ivorypearlg,i figured low 300's because of the new m only having 400 ponies
3910,"August 18, 2005 10:35PM",ivorypearlg,"yes but there 600+ monster of a car will be a lot more then $70,000 ! the price will more like be $170,000. mercedes is not going down hill ! i never said that most of the people in my neighborhood drive mercedes."
3911,"August 18, 2005 10:38PM",bmwe90,"we should really categorize and prioritize problems. my infiniti was undriveable at times - leaving me stranded often, which makes the problem with your 330 pale in comparison. i would have at times given anything to experience engine hesitation at 4k. i was put into a rental car that in order to maintain pace with traffic and not pose a hazard had to pretty much stay above 4k at all times. the law firm who handled my lemon law case repeatedly told me that infiniti was the worst company to deal with. i was turned down by several attorneys who when they found out my car was branded infiniti, wanted nothing to do with it. call a lemon law attorney and drop the name infiniti and watch them run. they are hell on wheels. meanwhile i was in the court parking lot the day i received my handsome settlement (even the devil himself sometimes gets caught, and when he does boy do they make him pay) and guess who shows up in a m3- the corporate attorney for infiniti. i guess actions do speak louder than words..."
3912,"August 18, 2005 10:40PM",ivorypearlg,lets start somthing new cause i am tired of talking about bmw....
3913,"August 18, 2005 10:46PM",ivorypearlg,thats funny because when my scheduled mantaince comes around along with the time the fold down seat broke i received a current infiniti model and i know the the g35x or the fx45 they usually give me is not working its [non-permissible content removed] off to keep up with highway traffic usually it is the highway traffic trying to keep up with me ! one more thing wouldn't he be representing nissan corp. since nissan is the parent company.
3914,"August 18, 2005 10:47PM",bmwe90,"i got tired of talking about them before i bought 2 german cars.  :blush:it's funny because after i got my first i couldn't stop talking about them. if you want to still talk about cars in the class may i recommend another top performer that now deserves a little newfound conversation. the mb c350. i just got the e350 and the engine is great, i can only imagine it in an even lighter, more nible car."

3917,"August 18, 2005 10:55PM",ivorypearlg,well then i must be a special customer because i always get current infiniti model cars. infiniti of willow grove !
3918,"August 18, 2005 10:58PM",ivorypearlg,yes they are treating me good ! i just ordered a ivory pearl fx45 for my wife ! i will be done financing my g35 coupe in november .. i am going to buy another infiniti then too maybe a lexus or mercedes. i dont know yet !
3919,"August 18, 2005 11:00PM",blueguydotcom,did he say he needed rwd maybe he lives in snowy climates the saab will plow thru the snow while the rwd is350 and the 3's rwd and the rwd infin will be stuck in the garage. look at the acura tl too.. awd g is great also.i'll wait for the snow-living rwd owners to refute your 1980s thinking about rwd cars and snowy climates.
3920,"August 18, 2005 11:04PM",ivorypearlg,sorry but my brothers 330i is horrible in the snow ! he lives in maine. when it snows he cant drive his 330i so his wife drives him to work in her saab 9-5.\last time at infiniti a lady was trading in her g sedan for the g35x because she couldn't drive it in the snow. as for me i have the luxury of having 3 cars .

3934,"August 19, 2005  9:59PM",bmwe90,"if i had to do it over again, i would not have purchased the g35. but if you asked me if i made the logical and practical decision at the time - i would say yes, of course. from what i gather from the many happy g owners on this board, infinti does, in most cases, provide a great handling, midsize car for a good sum of $ less than bmw's 3 series. if i hadn't had my sour experience with infiniti, and i were in the market for a sport sedan - and money was a consideration (as it is for most of us) the g would definently be on my shopping list. the higher price of the 3 series does pose a problem for some buyers in this category, and at any rate, the g provides more interior room than even the new 3. i agree with you that these two cars are serving different targets, but those targets aren't too far apart. i did spend 35,000 miles behind the wheel of my g before it was gone. i have spent about 4k miles in my new 3 and the cars each have their strengths - along with very few weaknesses. i will give you guys/gals my honest opinion of each car (i'll pretend for fairness sake that nothing was wrong with my g)the g was very quick with it's 260 hp and torque. the car handled well at nearly all speeds but doesn't match bmw for handling at high speeds (90+). the bmw seems more at home the harder you push it while the infiniti feels like it's up to the task, but it does it with a straight face while the bmw does it with a smile. the bmw has the better interior hands down, quality wise, i wont comment on style because that very objective. the bmw is a tigher squeeze though, and most taller passengers will be asking the driver and font passenger to move up. it seems once you get situated in the bmw, no one complains from lack of space. the infinti's rear doors open much much wider than the bimmers, though - and the seats also recline in the g. the engines are a tossup, i think the inline 6 is smoother than the v6 in the infiniti but i will agree that infiniti's v6 is probably the second best engine i have ever owned. the transmission in the bmw has an extra gear and seems to shift smoother and quicker. i had a full size spare in my g and i loved it. i don't like the new run flats on my 3. i prefer the bmws brakes though. bmw does include maintenance, which is nice- but not a deal maker in any respect.they are both great performers and i think anywho who choses either is getting one of the best sport sedans available in this class."

4022,"August 23, 2005  3:05AM",shipo,"one factor that is significant in my mind is that bmws (and mbs and vws and audis) are built to obtain their best gas mileage at speeds well beyond what we typically drive here in the u.s.a., the epa and their 49 mph test be damned.  when i was picking up my ed 530i i spent the first 1,300 miles or so keeping the car under 100 mph, and during that most critical of break in periods i obtained between 26 and 28 mpg.  for the last sprint back into munich i had the cruise control set at 130 and according to the trip computer i was still getting between 23 and 24 mpg.  geez, my 530i was getting about the same mileage at a buck thirty that a g35 gets at half that speed.now, being one that habitually refutes anecdotal evidence, i must admit that over the last seven years of contributing here in the townhall i seen literally hundreds of posts by bmw 3-series and 5-series drivers claiming mileage well beyond the epa numbers (and precious few that couldn&#146;t).  once again, in my mind that is significant.  in fact, a few months ago in the 5-series forum, a contributer was complaining that his e39 530i was barely able to make the epa numbers.  the rest of us kept maintaining that there was something wrong with his car, contrary to what his dealer was telling him.  i mentioned to him that i was aware that there was at least one round of firmware out of munich that was, ummm, less than optimal, and suggested that he have his obc reflashed.  bingo!  he immediately started getting mileage more in line with what the rest of us had been telling him he should be experiencing, which by the way was well beyond the epa numbers.best regards,shipo"

4062,"August 30, 2005  5:30PM",oac,"you gotta ask yourself, how did a slower car that broke down beat out a brand new contender that sprang from the most powerful and financially flush company in the world?....a vast automotive conspiracy? bias?bgdc: on the face of it, that an unreliable bmw beat out a new is350 smark of conspiracy, don't ya think ? let's see, of the 3 major cateogries - vehicle, powertrain and chassis, the is350 beat out the 330i in 2 of 3 (vehicle and powertrain), but lost in the chassis category. hmmm ! the is350 is a better car where it matters, vehicle (fit-and-finish, ergonomics, style, etc) and powertrain (performance, engine flexibility, tranny, etc). gotta-have-it-factor: dead tie. fun-to-drive: 23-to-22, a virtual tie. so how exactly did this broken down, unreliable e90 win ? and if you die-hard fanatics cannot even see that these two cars are a virtual tie, you must have more denial than i think...but more to your point: we all know how much these auto rags rave about the 3-series as the benchmark of bmw automotive engineering excellence. to beat that car will take a herculian task. and the is350 did, even with a slushbox ! the measured (objective and subjective) difference b/w the e90 and the is350 is infinitesimal, at best... virtual tie at worst. that it took lexus 6 years to beat the vaunted 3-series is what counts, not the unreliability of the bimmer or the money flush at toy/lexus. at least, they put their money where their mouth is."
4063,"August 30, 2005  5:39PM",oac,"don't look now, but the ""total package"" is missing a manual transmission (assuming you're referring to the is350). as you yourself expressed, ""just imagine the is with a 6mt."" imagine? i'd rather they actually make one available, but that's just me. for how many people in the na market ??? even bmw sells far more slushboxes than stick shifts. so ?the is300 i drove had more hp & ""tq"" than the 325i (e46) i bought. why did i buy the 3? because ""hp isn't everything,"" and that's a fact.then what is ? oh, i forget... the name and the hype - the ultimate driving machine.. always trumps reality...i like the new is more than most, but without a clutch and h pattern shifter available the 350 isn't even a consideration. if i were looking at purchasing a new car this fall, i'd be looking seriously at the is250, not the is350. and you'll be missing out on the overall best car for ya money in the category. your loss is someone else's gain... there won't be enough is350s for the demand, you can bet that. by the way, a v6 is a step backwards over the previous i6the same ol' song from bmw officianados... the v6 in the is is smoother, more efficient, provides better mpg than an i6 can ever be. and it is technologically superior to an i6. there !"

4068,"August 30, 2005  6:31PM",bmwe90,"when buying my g a couple of years ago i remember the dealership plastered with an article titled ""the bmw beater"". when you told them you were also considering other options (namely the 3 series) they threw the book at you, literally (well the magazine reprint anyway). i bought the g. but even though the magazine touted the g as being a ""bmw beater"", they confessed that the only reason the bmw lost was because it was priced higher than a comparably equipped g. the g has been selling for some time now- and guess what? bmw has survived, no wait- thrived. i equate the upcoming lexus with the introduction of the g. i'm not one who pulls out a magazine and points to numbers when justifying my decision, but kdshapiro makes a good point- toyota, with all of their resources, were, despite their best effort and a truck load of hp, unable to bump bmw off its seat at the top. and some of you are not giving those of us in our early 20's enough credit- i choose the 3 over all the other models because i like a car that can hold it's own as a complete package. hp is not the deciding factor for me, and i'm sure its not the only consideration for many future bmw buyers.but, before everyone erupts in an argument over which sedan is superior- let the gosh darn thing arrive on us soil for sale before throwing punches. i bet bmw comes out on top in the end. it's quite a feat to unseat the old master- especially when he re invents himself with the help of one of the best automobile companies around..."
4069,"August 30, 2005  7:10PM",saigonboi21,i agree!!! just wait until the car gets here first instead of second guessing who's better. this discussion could go on forever. people's opinions will differ and taht's it. hard to change someone's mind once it's set on something. just wait til the is gets here- then we'll continue our convo ^_^

4385,"October 20, 2005  8:42PM",blueguydotcom,"here's a good breakdown on how the dsg works:http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/jk/031119.htminside the computer controlled gearbox there are four shafts: two input shafts and two output shafts. the input shafts are concentric, with one shaft passing through the centre of the other hollow input shaft. there are two multi-plate clutch packs similar to those found in automatic transmissions. each clutch pack connects one of the input shafts to the engine, so depending upon which is applied, either one of the two input shafts can transfer power. an oil pump at the rear of the gearbox supplies hydraulic pressure for the clutches.the speed gears are divided between the two output shafts. first, third, fifth and reverse gear are on one output shaft while second, fourth and sixth gears are on the other shaft. synchronisers are moved by the computer to lock each of the speed gears to their output shaft as required. each output shaft has a pinion gear that drives the differential.when the driver places the shift lever in drive, first gear is engaged inside the transmission, but the clutch doesn't engage until the driver steps on the gas. because the clutch is running in oil, it can slip without burning up, allowing the car to creep along in first gear just as an automatic would. step harder on the gas and the clutch is fully applied. a neat feature of the control system allows the driver to step on the gas and brake at the same time. audi calls it launch control and it allows f1-type starts. in sport mode with both pedals pressed, the engine revs to 3200 rpm. release the brake and the car launches in drag strip fashion.with the transmission engaged in first gear, the computer locks second gear to the other output shaft, but the input shaft clutch for that gear is not engaged. when it is time to shift, the computer releases the clutch for the first gear input and engages the clutch for the second gear input. in preparation for the next shift, the computer now shifts from first to third gear but leaves its clutch disengaged until the shift is requested. as the car's speed increases, the computer continues to pre-select the next gear so all it has to do is switch clutches. there is no grinding, no delays, and no shock.by monitoring driving style, the computer predicts whether the driver will request an upshift or downshift next so it can pre-select the correct gear. it is possible to fool the computer by driving erratically, but even if the wrong gear is pre-selected it only takes a fraction of a second for it to catch up. this transmission shifts fast, with shift times in the .03 to .04 second range. even an excellent driver has trouble matching that consistently, and this transmission can do it all day long."

4395,"October 21, 2005  2:13PM",designman,"perhaps there is problem with the general perception of transmission genre. the term &#147;sequential manual&#148; is somewhat of a misnomer, only half accurate hence misleading. both gear selection and torque conversion can be automated. the major difference between the true manual transmission and all others&#151;conventional automatic, sequential gearbox and cvt&#151;is that with the true manual transmission, the human being is not only the shifter, he is also the torque converter by way of the clutch pedal. he is an integral part of the transmission mechanism. it is the only type of transmission where torque conversion is not achieved automatically. perhaps another problem with perception is the term &#147;torque converter&#148;. although it is a specific part in the automatic transmission, torque conversion happens in all types of transmissions, but is not commonly associated with any type of transmission except the &#147;automatic&#148;. now to further convolute this mess, we must realize that the transmission itself&#151;any transmission&#151;is a torque converter. the part known as the &#147;torque converter&#148; is a transmission within a transmission. it may sound confusing but this may be because there are snags in the naming conventions to begin with. anyway, the bottom line of this rant is that with the manual transmission and only the manual transmissionhuman being = torque converter."

(btw, they did the same thing with the new gs)-manual transmissions have always been associated with sporting/performance applications.  again, why would you only offer a mt with your lower hp engine? again, this is not consistent with a goal of producing a sporty/performance vehicle.-at least i have to commend them on making the vehicle rwd.  acura is still trying to make sporty fwd vehicles to compare with bmw (though they do a fairly decent job of it!).(now for my bias) you rarely see a japanese made vehicle out-perform a comparable german made vehicle in any comparison (infiniti seems to be the rare exception to the rule)."
4427,"October 29, 2005  5:47PM",brightness04,"(now for my bias) you rarely see a japanese made vehicle out-perform a comparable german made vehicle in any comparison you said it: it's a very biased statement.  the whole statement hinges on your defnition of ""out-perform"" and ""comparable.""  there are plenty japanese cars that out accelearate and out-handle german cars in the same size segment.  ultimately, choosing a car is a balancing act among four things: size, sportiness (accelearation and handling) and luxury content, all three balanced against cost.  german car makers historically have endeared itself to car rags by cheating on three out of four categories: fielding a car that was substantially smaller than compeition (3 vs. tl, g, es, etc.),  with less luxury content and interior, plus at higher cost.  three out of four compromises made, any wonder it would win in the fourth category?  scientificly, there are two ways of defining what's comaprable: either by size or by cost.  the germans loses almost every time if either objective measures is held constant for comparison: tl and g beats 5, e and a6 on handling quite easily if size is the criterium for ""comparable.""   tl and g beat 325, c230 and a4 1.8/2.0 handily if price is the criterium for ""comparable."".   it is only when one relaxes standards and bias the ""comparable"" in favor of the germans that they would win compros; any wonder in the rigged result?  if you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury, chances are indeed good that you will get better handling unless the mfr is utterly incompetent."

4549,"November 20, 2005  6:13PM",brightness04,"oh by the way, fresh snow is usually not a problem, even if 18"" in 6hrs.  like i said, i drove down from boston to nyc in a rwd without no dsc or lsd in a snow storm, and on nearly-bald all season tires, while the snow was coming down so fast that a quick lunch break was enough to put enough snow on the bumper to cover up the headlights.  the drive was actually pretty simple: just follow the tracks made the by cars in front me.  flat highway, busy traffic actually makes snow driving a piece of cake, even on my bald all season tires.it's the overnight packed down re-frozen stuff on back country hilly roads that is dangerous."

4838,"January 27, 2006  9:10PM",nybmwguy,"here is a provactive comment.  there are essentially two cars in this segment to buy from.  all others are a waste unless you get an incredible deal.  agree or disagree?1.  bmw 3 series.  price the 325xi to a comparable mercecedes c240 or audi a4 2.0 and you find best value for what it offers (especially with new maintenance program that effectively brings the price down a bit more and if you opt for leatherette in price comparison).  i like audi, but not discounted sufficiently for its poorer record in quality and lower resale value.  comparably equipped car is only slightly cheaper and not worth the savings.  audi and mercedes don't have a single attribute over the 3 series in this category (though i prefer e o4 a6 to 5 series and s or a8 to 7-series). 2. acura tl.it is a blah car, but great quality, power and interior.  no option pricing, reliable, reasonably stylish.  g35 was ""the"" other car in this segment, but i can't see what the g35 has over the new tl and again, the tl is close in price so why go inifiniti (if you love infiniti beg, borrow and steal to get into the m35).volvo s60 - not comparable, underpowered, weaker quality, image, etc.saab 93 - nice, but a level under and comparable to a tsx.lexus i350 - not fun, cheap looking interior (to me), nothing compellinginfiniti g35 - buy the tl for same power and nicer quality (g35 coupe would be an exception for this rule if you are coupe person)audi a4- again, buy the 3 series for slightly more and make it back in service coverage, resale value and quality (also, interior is great quality, but seems dated).  bmw now has a reasonably proficient 4wheel drive system so quatro less key.mercedes c- too expensive, too many cut corners.  buy the e used or go for the bmw.cadillac -  not a bad car, but not compelling.  not cheap enoughlincolen zephyr - same price as any of the above and weaker than all of them."

4849,"February  2, 2006  7:35AM",brightness04,"i said: the key is not ""high value"" but inflated msrpyour response: you're splitting hairs. inflated msrp implies a value judgement. buying a car is a value judgment, the price is the price. it costs what it costs to you the consumer.  no personal value judgement was implied in my use of the term ""inflated msrp"" at all.  ""inflated msrp"" means an msrp that is far higher than actual market clearing price.  for example:mb e class with $5-7k manufacturer lease incentive, that indicates an inflated msrp.another example:both tl and 9-5 sell for about $31-32k in the market place; they are by definition comparable in ""value.""  yet, one of them has an msrp of $39k, whereas the other is around $34k.  the $5k difference is sheer ""inflated msrp"" that does not accrue at all in terms of ""value.""  in more than half of the 50 states, the inflated msrp gets taxed every year of a car's ownership."

4983,"May  6, 2006  6:06AM",primetime79,"let me preface my post by unequivocally stating the mere facts. i am not an automobile professional. i have no loyalty to any automobile manufacturer. i enjoy a exhilirating driving experience.three years ago (2003), i was in the market for a sedan that had a certain level of sport and luxury. i narrowed my search to four cars. 1.) bmw 330i 2.) audi a4 1.8t 3.) lexus is 300 4.) infinity g 35 . quickly this search was down to two as the lexus is 300 had absolutely nothing to offer in the form a luxury offering and the infinity was much of the same although not to lexus extreme. the ""feel"" of the steering wheel and all other components of the inifity made it quite apparent that the build quality of this car was not up to par. so it was down to two cars, the bmw 330i and the audi a4 1.8t. the 330i was much faster than the a4, but to me it lacked the handling prowlness of the a4. maybe it's me, but the 330i was not impressive at all. i felt like it was a regular family sedan. i have nothing against bmw, but sometimes i wonder if sometimes their maybe a little bit of brainwashing or speaking something to existent, with the over hyped driving (handling) experience. for me it came down to the getting the best car for me. the a4 exemplified te best handling (feedback), the best interior. the build quality on this car was impeccable. unfortunately due to circumstance beyond my control (wife) i had to trade in my audi a year ago for a suv. fast forward to the present, and i have been blessed to make the same purchase decision again. again it came down to the eact same 4 cars with a little thought given to the acura tsx. but after a close up encounter with the tsx , while the car is a phenomenal value it was apparent is was nothing more than that a ""phenomenal value"". so i test drove the same 4 cars again. the infinity now with the 6mt was a nice car but lacked in the same area interior refinement and the short throw clutch felt like my brothers 95 mitsubishi eclipse (cheap). next on the list was the audi. the new audi a4 had undergone some minor changes most notably hp improvement. overall the car was better than the one i once had, but suprisingly was 6k more similiarly equipped. this posed a problem. it was then down to two cars the is 350 and the 330i. lots of people do not like the new 330i exterior. but i think while it may not be a sporty as the is per se, it is definielty more profounding and unique. as usual when i went for my test drive of the bmw i walked into the dealership and was treated as an outkast. i guess this car either sells itself, or i did not look like the typical bmw client ready to make a purchase. in my usual car shopping attire i wore shorts, flip flops and a white wife-beater shirt with my bling bling on. finally someone came to help me and i was in the bmw 330i. first glance of the 330i interior i did know what to think. after 30 seconds of looking at it, this understated interior started looking growingly bland. once on the road, i could not figure out what all this hoopla was about. immediately i went straight to lexus dealership to figure out what changes lexus made to the is. at first glance i fell in love with it's beauty. i then told the sales person order me a black on black with navi, but it has to be manual. it was at that time my heart was broken. no manual for 350. never had i ever thought, i would own a sports/luxury car that was not manual. but the sales person was adamant that i at least try it out. the rest is history. i am a proud owner of a is 350 crystal white navi. this car is not only super quick but handles excellent. i have driven it several times with the vdim off and it makes a huge difference. around corners with the vdim on it cuts the throttle to quickly. i must advise the average driver to be careful, because this is a rwd car and they tend to spin out rather quickly. but after two weeks of owning it i am extremely ecstatic about my decision. i personally think bmw might be overhyped, audi are underpowered, infiiniti are built with less interior refinement and overall build quailty. lexus is 350 for me at least is the perfect blend, if you do not want to buy the car do not test drive it!!!!!!!!!p.s sorry i am a little long winded"
4984,"May  6, 2006  8:16AM",pgsmith,"my experience @ bmw was similar.  obviously i did not conform to their image of a bmw owner having worn a t-shirt and shorts into their showroom.  they wasted no time in regaling stories of who they knew when i explained where i worked (ho-hum, i was there to see the vehicles).  after we spent (too much) time in the the salesman's cubicle, i learned they did not have a car with the equipment they learned i might be wanting, but they would happily order it for me.i said great, but i wanted to actually drive a car to see if the car was really what i would like.  i was told that:1.  they did not even have a car that had an automatic (wife's requirement, not mine) i could test drive (which i saw later the same day on the lot). :confuse: 2.  they would not let me test drive a red car since i was not interested in red and that would put miles on a car someone else would buy. :confuse:3.  they had a blue one waiting to be prepped.  when i indicated that it might be ok to accept blue, the vehicle was not prepped even within a week, at which point i had to ""make them"" let me test drive the red one. :confuse: end results:1.  i was offended by their arrogance. :mad: 2.  i was not very impressed by the vehicle.3.  i bought a competitors vehicle (c280), which i am happy with.4.  i will continue to vehicle shop in the future in shorts, jeans, t-shirts, flip-flops, running shoes, as this will help me decide about they ability of the dealership to be confident in the car not try to sell the ""image"".5.  i will leave immediately any dealer who gives me this type of treatment in the future."
4985,"May  6, 2006 12:26PM",redsoxgirl,"i respect your right to have the opinion that the is350 is the right car for you, but i strongly disagee that it is even close to the ""best luxury/sport sedan"" on any objective basis.clearly you have a different definition of ""sport"" than i do as it pertains to how a car accelerates, handles, steers, brakes, performs - as well as how connected to the road and driver it is.  as evidence:the 330i was much faster than the a4, but to me it lacked the handling prowlness of the a4.how anyone could conclude the ""handling prowess"" of a 60/40 imbalanced fwd a4 is superior to that of the 50/50 balanced rwd 330i is an enigma.  are you sure you weren't overly enamored with the interior of the a4 to forget to put it through a serious test drive against the 330i?    never had i ever thought, i would own a sports/luxury car that was not manual. but the sales person was adamant that i at least try it out. the rest is history.again, perhaps having come out of a 170 hp a4, you were enamored with the 300+ hp is350.  but that automatic transmission removes any ""sport"" there might have been in the car for me.  sorry, drag racing doesn't fit my driving style.  i have never owned a bmw and i am not sure i ever will.  but in searching for a compact to mid size sport sedan to replace my boxster s this fall, the is350 doesn't make the long list, let alone the short list on the ""sport"" criteria.  great little luxury car, perhaps.  true sport sedan compared to the 3-series, no way.  at least not for me."
4986,"May  6, 2006  1:33PM",primetime79,just ought of curiousity. have you ever test driven the is 350 before.  because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter smooth. the car has excellent steering feel.  my only complaint is the vdim killing the throttle to early when the wheel starts losing traction. i guess i am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the is wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the bmw handles/feels/brakes better and declare them a winner.
4987,"May  6, 2006  4:11PM",redsoxgirl,"just ought of curiousity. have you ever test driven the is 350 before. because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter smooth.yes, i've driven the is350.  my cousins own a lexus dealership and they will sell me one (or any lexus model) for their cost, so i had hoped to like it.  the is350 is a decent automatic.  but it's an automatic.  it's probably better  than bmw steptronic, comparable to the mercedes/amg ""manumatic"" and not as good as the porsche tiptronic.  and i would never own one of those.  i wouldn't even be happy with the bmw m3 ""smg"" transmission.  it's not an ""objective"" performance thing for me, it's a subjective feel, control and driving enjoyment.  if you are enough of a ""driver"" to have tested the limits of the vdim and don't like that interference, i am surprised you don't agree, but that's your perogative. i am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the is wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the bmw handles/feels/brakes better and declare them a winner.i think your curiosity stems from thinking that 2 or 3 objective performance measures capture the entire essence of driving feel and enjoyment - and even true performance - for everybody.  gross oversimplification.  as a management consultant, i spend 60 hours a week boiling down complex business strategy and financial issues to a few spreadsheets, graphs and power point slides.  but at the end of the day, i can immediately tell you what executives ""get it"" and what ones don't, by how much they go behind the numbers rather than focus on them.  so the last thing i'm going to do is pick my next car by looking in the back of car and driver or road and track at a bunch of statistics without spending a lot of time in the drivers seat froming my own subjective opinions."
4988,"May  6, 2006  5:50PM",primetime79,"apparently we have a few things in common as i too am a financial/management professional (senior investment analyst).  i honestly felt exactly the same way you did about automatics before i test drove the is 350.  this is the first automatic i have ever owned.  the reason i don't have any significant issues with the vdim is because it only comes into play when i feel like driving the car to it's limit (2% of the time).  and besides as i mentioned you can easily turn it off in 15 seconds by starting the car with the parking brakes then tapping the brakes twice then the park brakes twice then the brakes twice.  this takes no more than 15 seconds.i love my 350 dearly, however my first choice would have been the m3 if i was only patient enough to wait for the new m3 to come out."
4989,"May  6, 2006 10:09PM",neko608,"i don't think it has anything to do with the make, but it's all about the dealership.  i went to motorwerks bmw and woodfield lexus (both in chicago area) and they were all great."
4990,"May  6, 2006 10:54PM",v_lad,"i was searching for a sedan in 30-35k price range recently and got to test drive lexus. the dealer talked me into trying automatic (i was very surprised they don't have manual with this engine). after getting into it i saw nice pad-shifters and was prepared for a good impression. but after a minute a realized that you can't control current gear of your car - you only limit your maximum gear. you don't even know the gear that's currently on! my current automatic subaru legacy(165hp) is more sportier in that aspect (it always shows the actual gear that's on). i can't say anything about handling - i simply hadn't got that far with a test drive. it's a luxury, but not anywhere near sport regardless of numbers. someone at lexus should be fired for that type of design."

4994,"May  7, 2006  3:06AM",laurasdada,"having never driven one because of the following, imho:credit to caddy for beginning to define/redefine itself with the cts.  however, the overdone, unattractive exterior and cheap looking, disjointed in design interior along with the window sticker sent me quickly on my way the first time i encountered the cts.  now, i may be missing a great ride, but i truly enjoy a nicely styled exterior and an interior that suits me is a must.  while the interior does not have to be of the ultimate in materials, i do want a logical and attractive layout (as a reference, audi and lexus do interiors right in my book) as, of course, that is where i spend my time driving.  the cts (which may have been upgraded since last i looked?) i found quite lacking, especially given the asking price.  but, i find all cadillac models a bit aggressive in their prices.  hence rebates and ""employee pricing...""i chose the acura tl as fwd is not a four letter word to me.  i grew up with fwd (saab, honda, mitsu, renault!, vw...) and appreciate the snow country advantage (new englnader & avid skier).  i believe that honda/acura produces the best handling fwds out there (and i know some rwd afficionados would consider that statement an oxymoron!) which suits me just fine.  i may lose out to rwd at 9 or 10/10ths, but that is really just not an issue to me.  in my comparison shopping, the tl offered the best combo of style, luxury, sport, economy, power and value.maybe the next cts will be a more suitable candidate."
4995,"May  7, 2006  6:41AM",corvettefan427,"the new cts should address the current models interior. based on spy photos i've seen, and a review i read from a journalist who saw the car and described the interior as outstanding. as far as the exterior, if you don't like caddy's styling theme, you probably still won't like the new one, although i think now that the styling has been introduced, it may be slightly more ''organic'' for 2008, although it's hard to tell."

4997,"May  7, 2006  9:43AM",davids5,"i am not sure that most people are on the same page here. most people may have their own definition of what a sport sedan is and what sporty driving is. working for the usaf in europe, active duty and civilian duty i feel that i have a good idea of what sporty driving and what a sports sedan is. have almost 23 years of driving experience in europe and 20 of them in germany.to me sporty driving isn't 0-60 spurts or 1/4 mile drag races,probably most of these so called sport sedans are not even equipped with the proper tires for high speed sporty driving. while most americans come over here for the first time with their so called sport sedans and wagens and think 80mph is fast when driving well over 100 mph is a daily and normal ocurance over here.you dont see american ford, gm,honda,toyota,etc burning up the track.many ruin there vehicles or even kill themselves trying to keep up and prove something against the real high speed and sport vehicles like mb,bmw,audi-vw (vag)and of course porsche.i feel that most have been brain washed and are easily sold on bells and sirens,dodads and smoke and mirror tricks that really dont do a thing for true performance and true longevity of a vehicle. i dont give a damn if one car has a better dvd-cd changer than the other car or has 20 cup holders.our american car industry needs to start building good solid dependable vehicles starting with high powered engines that dont spend most of its time at the garage or at the gas station because its such a gas hog.off base here in germany a gallon of gas cost $6.86.they build powerfull engines over here that use very little gas and last and gives you years of satisfaction......"
4998,"May  7, 2006  1:41PM",redsoxgirl,"sorry, but after another test drive late yesterday, i am even more convinced the is350 is not for me.  in my opinion, if lexus were serious about ""sport"" they would have a manaul 6-speed or at least fast shifting smg.  blueguydotcom is right, this is a painfully slow downshifting transmission for anyone who really prefers the control of picking their own gear at any time.but even with a manual transmission, i still think the suspension and steering feedback are a couple of rungs down from bmw.  i hate to say it - because i don't like the car - but the g35 was better in that regard.lastly, re-read your ""15 second solution"" to overly interfering vdim.  porsche has a button.  bmw has a button.  this is not a solution from a comapnay that has any serious intention of backing up their ""sport"" marketing with the real thing.the lexus is350 is a nice car for someone other than me."
4999,"May  7, 2006  2:39PM",fedlawman,"""to me sporty driving isn't 0-60 spurts or 1/4 mile drag races""i tend to agree with you for the most part, but i don't think you can generalize ""americans"" as a whole. historically, europeans have placed a higher value on handling than straight-line speed, but things have changed today. american cars today handle as well as they accelerate, and todays european cars have placed an emphasis on 0-60 and 1/4 mile performance - why do you think that is?the roads here are different, as are the laws (because our society is different). as a result, driving is different here. so, while i agree overall that european cars tend to perform better than american cars, let me play devil's advocate here and consider some current american cars - although they're not my cup of tea personally, i could go to a dealer tomorrow and purchase a 2006 corvette or cadillac sts for less than $40,000. are they as good as the european ""equivalent?"" not likely, but they are outstanding cars in their segment and cost 1/2 to 1/3 the price of a ""comparable"" european car. the corvette may not have the elegance and refinement of a porsche 911, but on a twisty road or racetrack, they're pretty comparable. both are rewarding to drive and own in their own way - a personal choice. the cadillac vs. mercedes is a similar comparison. i've been driving an s-class mercedes for 2 years now (company car) and, while it is a very substantial car and suprememly comfortable, it's not at all rewarding to drive from a performance perspective. it floats over the road with light, overboosted steering, and rolls hard in corners. i haven't driven the cadillac, but i can't imagine it's significantly worse than the m-b.so, while i personlly prefer and own european cars (i have an e30 bmw m3 and a volvo v70), i can understand why someone might enjoy the performance and personality of american cars for what they offer the driver - especially on our poorly maintained, poorly designed american roads."

5017,"May  9, 2006  5:53PM",gordonwd,"i moved from a '98 a4 1.8t quattro to a '04 (non-sport)325i, so feel qualified to make a comparison. the 325i, imo, is superior to the a4 in most every way that counts to me (except for driving in the snow on stock all-season tires). it's not nearly as much contrast as what blueguy says, but we all know that he tends to be somewhat -- shall we say? -- strong in his opinions.   first off, the difference in horsepower was very evident. the 325i is no hotrod at a rated 185 (?), but i think the a4 was only rated at 150, and we all know that bmw's horses tend to be larger than most. the handling on the bimmer is definitely crisper, and brought an actual ""wow!"" out of me the first time i took it through some real esses. i had never felt turn-in like that before, since i'd been driving fwd for many years, and detroit rwd sleds before that.other than that, the ride and road manners are very comparable, and both are very quiet and comfortable out on the highways. but the a4 could definitely run out of steam in some passing situations on the two-laners. the interior of the a4 was very nice, and it definitely had better climate control logic, but now i'm so used to the 325's cockpit-style dash that i was disappointed in the interior styling of the e90.as for styling, i really think that the a4 peaked out with the model that i owned and that the later revisions and new models have gotten steadily worse. that latest grille is scary and reminds me too much of an edsel (if any of you out there remember those days). i also think that the 3-series styling peaked out with the facelifted e46 (just coincidentally the model that i happen to own), but styling is always a matter of opinion.so i really don't think that drivers of either brand have cause to throw stones at the other, especially when there are so many other brands more worthy of being thrown at."

5064,"May 29, 2006 10:02PM",blueguydotcom,"like i said, i ordered an 06 330i with 6 speed manual, leather, sport package, xenons, power seats/roof, comfort access (keyless ignition/entry) and pdc (park distance control) for less than 36k - msrp of 41k. the exact car and color i wanted. now, try going to lexus and ordering an is350 with the sport package and xenons.  best of luck on getting that car.  when i visit the lexus site it won't even show me a sport package equipped car.  i called dealerships and they all offered to order the car for me - with a deposit and zero info on its delivery time.  better luck still getting that car in the exact color you want and for less than msrp. you're looking at over 39.7k - assuming a dealer will try to ""order"" (can't really order a lexus) an is350 for you that way.  of course he's gonna demand a deposit, it may take from 4-8 months to get the car and service isn't free (add at least another $1500 for service - brakes, oil changes, tune ups- over 45k miles).so, no the lexus is350 isn't in the same ballpark as a 330i as i wanted one.  it wasn't even close.  my 330i  cost considerably less than the is350 with sport/xenons, which if it ever arrived would have been crippled by an automatic transmission."
5065,"May 30, 2006  2:16AM",habitat1,"with all due respect to those that might shop both the is350 and 330i and make the decision based upon price, i think you're in the minority.neither of these cars are inexpensive and the purchase decision is likely to be based upon personal preference, not a couple thousand dollars.  with respect to the is and 330, at least to me, they are very different in their driving character.   i really don't think these cars are seriously cross shopped as much as this forum might suggest.  casually cross shopped, maybe.  but if you prefer bmw handling, steering and driving dynamics, it's unlikely that 300 hp stuffed into an automatic sedan with a lexus suspension is going to get you to switch your preference.  and if you prefer lexus interior aesthetics and ample electronic do dads, along with exceptional relability,  you're probably not going to switch your preference to a more spartan drivers car.so, my guess is that the price/value debate is more of a friendly joust than a real factor for 90% of buyers.  lexus could sell the is350 for $20k and i won't buy an automatic sport sedan.  not picking on lexus - i wouldn't even buy the $85k m5 smg for a similar discount."

5247,"July 30, 2006  4:11PM",blueguydotcom,"the 335i rumor didn't surface until around march/april this year if my recollection is right.your recollection is wrong.  back in june of 05 people were already talking about the turbo engine from bmw.  on bimmerfest the war had already broken out between the 3.5 people and the turbo people.  everybody knew a bigger 300 hp engine was on the way for 07.   exactly, the is350 isn't comparable to the underpower 325i the is250 is a better candidate, both on price and performance. no, the is250 is quite simply a joke.  all around sad.  it's slow, expensive, cannot be ordered to specific specs without great trouble and has lousy handling.  the is350 is the same.  thus, i wrote exactly what i intended, the is350 can't even compare to a lowly e90 (or e46) 325i.   they need a product that's fast enough to make the 3 series a class benchmark again. bmw has never been the fastest in their segment.  they don't sell cars based on 0-60 times.acceleration: draw with a slight advantage toward the again, this isn't a bmw thing.  the 325i e90 on a track will devour the is350 all day long.  no need to be faster off the line if you can take a corner at a much higher rate of speed.interior/luxurious: hands down lexusi disagree.  the lexus interior is too soft and small.  it's plush, coddling and worst of all you can't see anything out of the rear windows.  and you can't order it to specs.   so again, we are back at the same conclusion as earlier: if you want handling, get a bimmer; if you want luxurious, get the lexus.i believe this area is the entry level performance sedans...thus the lexus fails for many reasons (some already mentioned):lack of manual - the automanual in the lexus is a piece of steaming dog vomit.  it's extremely slow to react - like all automanuals.  try a double downshift at 65 mph...the automanual allows it after a several second delay.  lack of ordering ability.  you cannot order an is350 as you desire.  talk to a lexus dealership.  want it with xenons and that's it?  good luck.  you have to wait and wait and lexus may never build the car you want.  you simply cannot order the car as you want it.maintenance - the is350 will cost money to maintain over a 3 year lease.  not so the bmw.  btw, turning off the vdim won't change the loose handling, vague roadfeel, body rolls and in-general soft design of the buick-like is350."

5390,"August 11, 2006 12:55AM",jzalkin,"here it is.  i will call you out as an idiot and you will be ridiculed by all if you argue against the basic points.point 1:  all of these cars (3 series, is, g35, c class, cts, tl) belong in this group.  some are newer and some are getting long in the tooth, but they all are competition. if a lot off people cross shop a model then it is competition.  if only a few then it is not.  i bet almost everyone looked at a few of these model before selecting their car.point 2:  different is good.  it leads to choices and ability to get the best fit for them.  some difference help and some hurt.  sales will determine if a model is a success.  point 3:  just because you want a feature - does not make it the end all be all definition.  just because you think a car should have a manual does not mean everyone else does.  just because the tl is not rwd, does not mean it does not belong.  get over yourself - you are not the resident expert.  you are just like the rest of us posting nothing more than your opinion.  if you will only drive a manual then i guess that matters to you.  since the vast majority of people (bmw buyers included) do not drive a manual - that is not a criteria for selection.  i could not see anyone saying ""i want an automatic, but i won't look at the is since the 350 does not offer a manual.""  does anyone else see the absurdity of this argument?point 4:  berating others is childish just makes you look like and idiot.  enough said.point 5:  no one car is the overall best.  one may be best given certain criteria, but another criteria will put another car on top.  -----------i picked the is for me.  came down to the bmw and i just didn't like it as much.  i had the a4 and just didn't love the bmw with i-drive (nav) in it."

(on the flip side there are many who are extremely pleased with not only how their cars drive, but how well they run).  lexus has an impeccable reputation for customer service & quality.  if they could take a small percentage of bmw owners away from their stick shift, sports package equipped 3ers they'd build on a performance reputation that will only help them grow more.  how about people moving up from 6 speed, v6 honda accords who are ""afraid"" of buying a german car?  there is definitely a market for an is350 manual w/ sportier suspension.i'll admit that acceleration was blistering when i drove the 300+ horsepower is350 at a lexus driving event.  the suspension was sloppy & floaty, the steering felt way too light and disconnected to the road.  the brakes were touchy & artificial feeling.  the lack of a manual tranmission made it even harder to swallow.  the 330ia (255hp version) equipped with sports package & slushbox felt much more alive in my hands.  i jumped in and it felt like the car was my own.  you definitely felt the power deficit of the bmw.  the steering was spot on.  handling was neutral.  the bmw felt light on its feet.  the brakes were strong and easy to modulate."

5427,"August 15, 2006  2:09PM",graphicguy,"kd....i'm on a different side of the fence regarding the interior of the 3 series compared to the is.  when shopping, i also wandered over to the audi store since they were offering a6q's for $9k off msrp.  i liked the audi interior the best.  their reputation for making the best interiors in the premium end is well-deserved.i always do the ""knuckle wrap"" test on interior surfaces.  no matter where i tapped in the 3 series, it was clear bmw used high quality, well put together parts.  the whole car, from the doors to the dash, had a ""bank vault-like"" feel.  plus, the wood was more abundant and better looking in the 3 series than in the is (whose wood looked like plastic, imho).didn't get that same result with the is on the knuckle wrap test.don't get me wrong, i thought the lexus interior was nice.  the bmw had more of an understated elegance to it in comparison, though (as did the audi).  but, that's not the real reason we buy bmws....it's the drive, ride, performance of the cars that gets us.breifly looked at the cts...not bad, but i always qualified it with the adder...not bad for gm.  there was still a lot of large expanses of plastic.  and the knuckle test didn't do much to float my boat, either."
5428,"August 15, 2006  2:16PM",kdshapiro,"i think we have the same general opinion. when i test drove the top end cts (not the v), i thought caddy did a great job on the interior, ok ride and ok exterior.the interior was soothing. which after the drive led me to the following observation about interiors and interior color: understated interior look best in dark colors, while overstated interiors look best in lighter colors."
5429,"August 15, 2006  2:26PM",habitat1,"well, imo i think the only people qualified to say that driving a smg/dsg porsche, amg, m and (especially) ferrari isn't serious sport are:  1. race car drivers 2. fighter pilots 3. astronauts  i wonder which group does habitat1 belong to?none of the above.  but i do have a functioning left foot and right hand, and prefer using both in a sports sedan or sports car.  note, i did not say a million dollar formula one race car.  which is capable of 4+ g's in flat out tight turns and, as such, places a premium on having both hands on the wheel.  i'm pretty sure that most race car drivers would prefer an smg at monaco rather than having to do multiple sets of 100 lb arm curls like they used to in the 70's.  but from the smg/dsg cars i've driven, that don't require forearms like arnold to control, i find smg/dsg's to take away too much from the direct control and fun to drive experience.     for the record, i had my opinion in 1978 when i bought my first new car (a $4,000 datsun b210 gx 4-speed).  and when we bought our 1995 nissan maxima se 5-speed (which we still own with 155k miles).  so the fact that i am now fortunate enough to own a 911 didn't change either my opinion on manual transmssions or of my own intelligence.  i'm just as dumb and stubborn now as i've always been.   for the posters here defending a right to have an opinion, thanks.  and louiswei, that right applies to you, too."

5434,"August 15, 2006  6:46PM",louiswei,"side by side pictures comparo won't do any good...first off let me say that i totally agree with you 100% on every car in this segment are loaded with plastic. however, 2 very important factors determined if the interior feels ""plastic-ish"" or not:1. percentage of hard-plastic used.2. quality of the plastic used.if the interior used too much hard-plastic, it might looks good but once you touched it, it'll feel cheap. same thing goes to lower-grade quality plastic. the caddy probably didn't use more plastic than audi but it definitely used more hard-plastic and the quality are lower grade."
5435,"August 15, 2006 10:19PM",jordanrobinson,"getting back to the topic i thought i was posting in, what do you guys consider entry-level?  and what qualifies as performance?  for instance would a ford fusion (v6) be considered performance?  granted it doesn't have a manual available, but the 6-speed auto does a decent job.  the 4-cyl has the manual but even being a good size 4 it doesn't offset the weight well enough.  so i guess my questions are (being new to the forums and this discussion) is there some kind fo standard that has to be met to be considered entry-level and ""performance"" sedan?  (other then the obvious.)  some people would argue that a 4-door civic can perform.  but i would disagree. a lot. thanks!"
5436,"August 15, 2006 10:32PM",pat,"it's not just ""entry-level"" and ""performance"", but also ""luxury"".  neither the fusion nor the civic fit in that last category.  you might want to check out the midsize sedans comparison thread for comparison conversations involving the fusion and the economy sedans (~$16k-$20k) where the corolla is included - admittedly at the top of that scale.check out the top of the discussion - that's where you will find the topic focus.  other vehicles may come and go, but the ones listed at the top usually form the core of the conversations.by the way, welcome to carspace!  if i can help you find anything, please feel free to drop me an email."
5437,"August 15, 2006 11:23PM",jordanrobinson,"thanks pat!!  since we're on the topic and it seems to fit better here, have any of you driven a new lincoln zephyr?  before i'm kicked out of the thread hear me out (and this is not a product advertisement, my dealership only does ford/mercury, no lincoln.. yet..)  anyway, i recently drove a zephyr after being told it was a lot like a fusion.  they were very wrong.  not only is the v-6 tuned to be much beefier, but the suspension is very different and the amenities make much more of a luxury vehicle. (i checked the first post and i believe all the requirements for the thread are here!)  now, i realize compared to a lot of what you folks are referring to (bmw, audi, etc) the zephyr is underrated and outclassed to some extent.  but it also stickers for right around $30k with a lot of style and luxury options such as leather, 3 stage heated and cooled seats, etc.  it certainly impressed me more then the cts i drove.  any opinions/experiences?"
5438,"August 16, 2006 12:38AM",louiswei,"imo, i think zephyr barely fits the entry-level luxury category but definitely not the ""performance"" and that's from a so-called poseur like me (because i drive an automatic). many hardcored enthusiasts in this board will tell you that in order to be a ""real"" performance sedan one needs to:1. have a manual tranny2. be a rwd or awdunfortunately zephyr has neither of those.also, as many cars under this segment are pushing 300+ hp, zephyr with 221 hp is definitely underpowered. just like many said before that the es350 (which is not in this category) is a dressed up camry i think zephyr is just a dressed up fusion as well.those are just my opinions (educated or not)."
5439,"August 16, 2006  1:01AM",jordanrobinson,"all wheel drive is coming in the 2007 model (at least for the fusion, so i assume the zephyr will have it also) but you got me on the manual gearbox.  a 6-speed manual would definetly score some points. (even though i also concede it would not make up for the 80 or so hp that it lacks as well.)  maybe ford will develop a svt fusion.  it could throw all the amenities the zephyr offers in with a mustang v-8, awd, and a six speed manual.  i'll let you know when they announce it.   in the meantime thanks for humoring me!"
5440,"August 16, 2006  1:04AM",louiswei,"even if ford comes out with the svt fusion, it still won't be an ""entry luxury performance sedan"". it'll be a worthy competitor to mazdaspeed 6 and subaru legacy though."

5529,"September  6, 2006  4:37PM",kernick,"well my definition of a manual is a transmission with a clutch-pedal.  anything else regardless of whether it has a clutch a rubber-belt (cvt), dsg, a torque converter or whatever is an automatic.  they are just different variations of automatic operation.  imo, an automatic transmission is one that you don't have to intervene with, unless you want to. in general: if a person can do anything better than a machine, it is simply a matter of time until that machine is evolved (designed) to be better.  a person may enjoy shifting a manual and controlling the car in general, but more and more functions of a car can be better handled by the machine.on the cars being discussed here, i think either transmission is acceptable.  i wouldn't worry about 0.2 sec difference or whatever in ""optimum launch"" acceleration, when this class of vehicle is not optimized for speed anyway.  the cars being discussed here are too big, too heavy, and too small of displacement (at least without forced induction) to really quibble about their performance.i'd take the '07 g35x as the pick of the class for having adequate power combined with all-weather awd, at a decent price."

5532,"September  7, 2006  1:00AM",robertr,agree with your definition of what an automatic is.  i  dislike automatics (=anything without a clutch) for a number of reasons. one in particular is i like to control how and when my car shifts.  i hate it when you want to accelerate suddenly with an automatic - you floor the gas - then there is a delay - then it downshifts with a big jerk - then it finally goes with more power than you want but too late when you could have finessed it with an anticipatory double-clutched smooth downshift to the proper gear with smooth throttle application in a manual. a skillfully driven stick is still much smoother and more controlled than an automatic in all driving conditions despite automatics having gotten much better in recent years.  the 2007 g35 automatic rev-matching feature on downshifts is the latest interesting improvement - i wonder if it will eliminate the jerk on the downshift that i experience everytime i get a loaner when my car is in for service.  nevertheless it will be a long long time before i want to give up the fun and satisfaction of driving a true manual.

5551,"September  9, 2006  3:43PM",kdshapiro,"i combine the sales across the different model types. it's not my issue that acura doesn't have a coupe or convertible. same for infiniti. the fact that a buyer walks in and buys the convertible, the sale should be counted. this is still the entry level luxury category.in fact i've said in the past, if you don't want to count convertibles, take the convertible sales off the competitors numbers."
5552,"September  9, 2006  3:44PM",kdshapiro,"the official bmw slogan is the ""ultimate driving machine"" ymmv.  but generally the trade/press accepts the 3 series as the benchmark for the class.i'm sure that's what you meant."
5553,"September  9, 2006  4:47PM",ggesq,"whatever way you want to combine the sales is fine. bottom line is- bmw 3 series sedan sells the most in the entry level sedan"" segment."
5554,"September  9, 2006  6:12PM",jrock65,"the 3 series sedan is the best selling 4 door in this segment, no doubt.the g35 coupe is the best selling 2 door in this segment though.  even if you combine all of the coupe, convertible, and m3 versions of the 3 series.ytd sales:g35 coupe: 14,800325ci, 325ci convertible, 330ci, 330ci convertible, 328i coupe, 335i coupe, m3, m3 convertible: 13,711it's a pretty big accomplishment for a first generation model like the g35 coupe to outsell the all of the variations of the benchmark 2 door in the class.  it is by far infiniti's biggest success ever.they are supposedly adding a convertible version for the new g37 coupe coming out next year."

5589,"September 12, 2006 12:41AM",texasmerq,"the lancer evo uses a very large turbo and to get the impressive acceleration numbers you have to keep the revs pretty high (3k-5k.) it is a very fun car to drive, especially on back roads with no traffic or police. that said in real world day to day for the average driver the 335i is probably faster as the torque comes in very early (1400-1800 rpm) and stays around past the normal shifting range in day to day driving (5k rpm.)i drove the 335i coupe this weekend but they only had automatics. they did shift extremely smoothly and quickly though. it was much better than i expected out of an automatic. i do prefer the rear view of the coupe, but i think i will wait on the 335i sedan personally because i prefer the overall styling of it more. to reiterate the steering did feel tighter which isn't necessarily a bad thing.i emailed an associate of mine who works for bmw in germany and she said 335i sedans should become availible stateside beginning in otober and should be saturated in most markets by late november. it has been availible there since mid-june i believe. if your dealer said it wasn't coming then they obviously just wanted to move units on the lot. i won't say not to work with them but let them clearly know what you want and if they won't supply the service take your business elsewhere."

5640,"September 20, 2006  5:56PM",dewey,"i wouldn't because i'm not very fond of my e90 330i. it's too quiet, too muted, too refined and too slow. even with power, that won't make up for the car's lack of soul or energy. the g and is were that much worse that i picked a car i found lackluster. ouch for infiniti and lexus. cruddy car chosen only because the other options weren't even up to that low standard. lol,there is just no pleasing you.i've heard the audi rs has a lot of soul. but the price of that soul is almost as dear as the soul of a saint.  i guess the soul you are seeking is within the body of a small hatchback like a gti or mazda3speed. i like small hatchbacks myself but unfortunately for practical purposes i need something bigger.being practical really sucks."
5641,"September 20, 2006  5:57PM",blueguydotcom,"something tells me the 335 is substaintially more expensive than the is350. actually, the 330 is already more expensive than is350. wsay what?  an is350 with sport package and xenons is in the mid 39k range.  the same 330i, sp, leather, xenons was 40k range. but the bmw provides you with 4 years of free service - at least a $500 savings.  i'd say that'd make it a wash.  except you can't really order an is350: rather you wait months to see if lexus will build your car.  you can customer order a bmw, not so a lexus.  a bmw cca rebate - available to any member of bmwcca - nets you $500 too.  where's the savings of the is350?my 330i was 35.7k through european delivery (msrp of 41k+).  hmm, that's a good 3k+ below the cost of the lexus. not including free maintenance.yeah the 335i is 1800 more expensive, so now you have a legit case for saying the 335 is more expensive than the is350.  but then again, considering the is350 is outperformed in everything but straightline by the 06 330i, it seems to reason for better driving in all circumstances - acceleration, handling, roadfeel, slalom, etc, the 335i is worth it to someone who cares about performance.  of course, ed on a 335i with my options will only be 37-38k.  that's still cheaper than an is350.  as of now, bmw already obliterates the is350 in the form of m3, why wait for the 335?it's an ugly coupe.  it's overpriced.  lemme see, e46 body/ chassis. ugly/worthless 2 door coupe and 3.2 liter gas guzzler for 50k or get an 07 335i sedan for 38k ed and 20/28 mpg?  that's a real easy call.    and for anyone about to bark they don't have time...whatever.  1 day off from work to get the car is not a big deal.  you waste more time here in a month than that."

(correct me if otherwise)btw, the bmw site listed 335's 0-100km acceleration to be 5.6s for manual and 5.8s for auto. you can argue it handles better than is350. but the acceleration won't obliterates is350. you still got to use m3 for that purpose."

(apologies to any s-type lovers out there, but that's just my personal opinion.. i don't see the point in getting the s-type with the x-type available.. from my perspective, either fork out for the xj, or keep your pennies with the x-type).i'll eat my words for one exception to the s-type family - the s-type r. it's a monster. 400 hp, and smooth as silk. i had the pleasure of getting to take a test drive in one of these... pretty much no words to describe how much i love driving this car. but, i would rather have the xjr for about ca$15k more, or the xkr, whenever that becomes available up here.in the end, it may all wind up being a matter of personal choice. i see bmw's everywhere (i live in the same town as bmw's canadian headquarters) and nobody looks twice because they  are so common now. imho, all their cars look alike (the 3, 5 and to some degree, 7 all look like slightly longer, or shorter versions of the same car) and i'm getting really sick on them... but a jaguar turns heads everywhere it goes - resale value notwithstanding./da"

(on avg)why do i give a rat what your company attorney gets paid ???? do you own the company and over pay him ???? just because you are self employed that makes your opinion better than mine ?  i will easily pull in over $60,000 this yr. with zero overtime. i'm in the top 20% in this country. i guess if that's being an under-achiever then label me as such. :surprise: it's not a matter of ""if"" i can afford a $43,500 car, but is the car ""worth"" $43,500. most bmw's owners paid for the badge, rather than the car imho. i'm don't need to ""attack you"" the same like you did me to get my point across.rocky"
